13</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>It is the desire of every American to see New York, the largest and most
wonderful city in the Union.&nbsp; To very many the city and its 
attractions are familiar, and the number of these persons is increased by 
thousands of new comers every year.&nbsp; A still greater number, however, 
will know the Great City only by the stories that reach them through their 
friends and the newspapers.&nbsp; They may never gaze upon its beauties, 
never enjoy its attractions in person.&nbsp; For their benefit I have 
written these pages, and I have endeavored to present to them a faithful 
picture of the &ldquo;Lights and Shadows&rdquo; of the life of this City, 
and to describe its &ldquo;Sights and Sensations&rdquo; as they really 
exist.</p>
<p>This Great City, so wonderful in its beauty, so strange to eyes 
accustomed only to the smaller towns of the land, is in all respects the 
most attractive sight in <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>America, and one of the most remarkable places 
in the world, ranking next to London and Paris in the extent and variety of
its attractions.&nbsp; Its magnificence is remarkable, its squalor 
appalling.&nbsp; Nowhere else in the New World are seen such lavish 
displays of wealth, and such hideous depths of poverty.&nbsp; It is rich in
historical associations and in treasures of art.&nbsp; It presents a 
wonderful series of combinations as well as contrasts of individual and 
national characteristics.&nbsp; It is richly worth studying by all classes,
for it is totally different from any other city in the world.&nbsp; It is 
always fresh, always new.&nbsp; It is constantly changing, growing greater 
and more wonderful in its power and splendors, more worthy of admiration in
its higher and nobler life, more generous in its charities, and more 
mysterious and appalling in its romance and its crimes.&nbsp; It is indeed 
a wonderful city.&nbsp; Coming fresh from plainer and more practical parts 
of the land, the visitor is plunged into the midst of so much beauty, 
magnificence, gayety, mystery, and a thousand other wonders, that he is 
fairly bewildered.&nbsp; It is hoped that the reader of these pages will be
by their perusal better prepared to enjoy the attractions, and to shun the 
dangers of New York.&nbsp; It has been my effort to bring home to those who
cannot see the city for themselves, its pleasures and its dangers, and to 
enable them to enjoy the former <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>without either the fatigue or expense demanded 
of an active participant in them, and to appreciate the latter, without 
incurring the risks attending an exploration of the shadowy side of the 
Great City.</p>
<p>To those who intend visiting New York, whether they come as strangers, 
or as persons familiar with it, the writer has a word to say, which he 
trusts may be heeded.&nbsp; An honest effort has been made in this work to 
present the reader with a fair description of the dangers to which visitors
and citizens are alike exposed.&nbsp; For the purpose of performing this 
task, the writer made visits, in company with the police officials of the 
city, to a number of the places described in this work, and he is satisfied
that no respectable person can with safety visit them, unless provided with
a similar protection.&nbsp; The curiosity of all persons concerning the 
darker side of city life can be fully satisfied by a perusal of the 
sketches presented in this volume.&nbsp; It is not safe for a stranger to 
undertake to explore these places for himself.&nbsp; No matter how clever 
he may consider himself, no respectable man is a match for the villains and
sharpers of New York, and he voluntarily brings upon himself all the 
consequences that will follow his entrance into the haunts of the criminal 
and disreputable classes.&nbsp; The city is full of danger.&nbsp; The path 
of safety which is pointed out in these pages is <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the only one for either
citizen or stranger&mdash;an absolute avoidance of the vicinity of sin.</p>
<p>Those who have seen the city will, I am sure, confirm the statements 
contained herein, and will acknowledge the truthfulness of the picture I 
have drawn, whatever they may think of the manner in which the work is 
executed.</p>

I.&nbsp; THE CITY OF NEW YORK</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; HISTORICAL.</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 1st of May, 1607, there knelt at the chancel of 
the old church of St. Ethelburge, in Bishopsgate street, London, to receive
the sacrament, a man of noble and commanding presence, with a broad 
intellectual forehead, short, close hair, and a countenance full of the 
dignity and courtly bearing of an honorable gentleman.&nbsp; His dress 
bespoke him a sailor, and such he was.&nbsp; Immediately upon receiving the
sacrament, he hastened from the church to the Thames, where a boat was in 
waiting to convey him to a vessel lying in the stream.&nbsp; But little 
time was lost after his arrival on board, and soon the ship was gliding 
down the river.&nbsp; The man was an Englishman by birth and training, a 
seaman by education, and one of those daring explorers of the time who 
yearned to win fame by discovering the new route to India.&nbsp; His name 
was <span class="smcap">Henry Hudson</span>, and he had been employed by 
&ldquo;certain worshipful merchants of London&rdquo; to go in search of a 
North-<i>east</i> passage to India, around the Arctic shores of Europe, 
between Lapland and Nova Zembla, and frozen Spitzbergen.&nbsp; These worthy
gentlemen were convinced that since the effort to find a North-<i>west</i> 
passage had <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>failed, nothing remained but to search for a North-<i>east</i> 
passage, and they were sure that if human skill or energy could find it, 
Hudson would succeed in his mission.&nbsp; They were not mistaken in their 
man, for in two successive voyages he did all that mortal could do to 
penetrate the ice fields beyond the North Cape, but without success.&nbsp; 
An impassable barrier of ice held him back, and he was forced to return to 
London to confess his failure.&nbsp; With unconquerable hope, he suggested 
new means of overcoming the difficulties; but while his employers praised 
his zeal and skill, they declined to go to further expense in an 
undertaking which promised so little, and the &ldquo;bold Englishman, the 
expert pilot, and the famous navigator&rdquo; found himself out of 
employment.&nbsp; Every effort to secure aid in England failed him, and, 
thoroughly disheartened, he passed over to Holland, whither his fame had 
preceded him.</p>
<p>The Dutch, who were more enterprising, and more hopeful than his own 
countrymen, lent a ready ear to his statement of his plans, and the Dutch 
East India Company at once employed him, and placed him in command of a 
yacht of ninety tons, called the <i>Half Moon</i>, manned by a picked 
crew.&nbsp; On the 25th of March, 1609, Hudson set sail in this vessel from
Amsterdam, and steered directly for the coast of Nova Zembla.&nbsp; He 
succeeded in reaching the meridian of Spitzbergen; but here the ice, the 
fogs, and the fierce tempests of the North drove him back, and turning to 
the westward, he sailed past the capes of Greenland, and on the 2nd of July
was on the banks of Newfoundland.&nbsp; He passed down the coast as far as 
Charleston Harbor, vainly hoping to find the North-<i>west</i> passage, and
then in despair turned to the northward, discovering Delaware Bay on his 
voyage.&nbsp; On the 3rd of September he arrived off a large bay to the 
north of the Delaware, and passing into it, dropped anchor &ldquo;at two 
cables&rsquo; length from the shore,&rdquo; within Sandy Hook.&nbsp; 
Devoting some days to rest, and to the exploration of the bay, he passed 
through The Narrows on the 11th of September, and then the broad and 
beautiful &ldquo;inner bay&rdquo; burst upon him in all its splendor, and 
from the deck of his ship he watched the swift current of the mighty river 
rolling from the north to the sea.&nbsp; He was full of hope now, and the 
next day continued his <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>progress up the river, and at nightfall cast 
anchor at Yonkers.&nbsp; During the night the current of the river turned 
his ship around, placing her head down stream; and this fact, coupled with 
the assurances of the natives who came out to the <i>Half Moon</i> in their
canoes, that the river flowed from far beyond the mountains, convinced him 
that the stream flowed from ocean to ocean, and that by sailing on he would
at length reach India&mdash;the golden land of his dreams.</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, he pursued his way up the river, gazing with wondering 
delight upon its glorious scenery, and listening with gradually fading hope
to the stories of the natives who flocked to the water to greet him.&nbsp; 
The stream narrowed, and the water grew fresh, and long before he anchored 
below Albany, Hudson had abandoned the belief that he was in the Northwest 
passage.&nbsp; From the anchorage, a boat&rsquo;s crew continued the voyage
to the mouth of the Mohawk.&nbsp; Hudson was satisfied that he had made a 
great discovery&mdash;one that was worth fully as much as finding the new 
route to India.&nbsp; He was in a region upon which the white man&rsquo;s 
eye had never rested before, and which offered the richest returns to 
commercial ventures.&nbsp; He hastened back to New York Bay, took 
possession of the country in the name of Holland, and then set sail for 
Europe.&nbsp; He put into Dartmouth in England, on his way back, where he 
told the story of his discovery.&nbsp; King James I. prevented his 
continuing his voyage, hoping to deprive the Dutch of its fruits; but 
Hudson took care to send his log-book and all the ship&rsquo;s papers over 
to Holland, and thus placed his employers in full possession of the 
knowledge he had gained.&nbsp; The English at length released the <i>Half 
Moon</i>, and she continued her voyage to the Texel.</p>
<p>The discovery of Hudson was particularly acceptable to the Dutch, for 
the new country was rich in fur-bearing animals, and Russia offered a ready
market for all the furs that could be sent there.&nbsp; The East India 
Company, therefore, refitted the <i>Half Moon</i> after her return to 
Holland, and despatched her to the region discovered by Hudson on a fur 
trading expedition, which was highly successful.&nbsp; Private persons also
embarked in similar enterprises, and within two years a prosperous and 
important <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span>fur trade was established between Holland and the country along 
the Mauritius, as the great river discovered by Hudson had been named, in 
honor of the Stadtholder of Holland.&nbsp; No government took any notice of
the trade for a while, and all persons were free to engage in it.</p>
<p>Among the adventurers employed in this trade was one Adrian Block, noted
as one of the boldest navigators of his time.&nbsp; He made a voyage to 
Manhattan Island in 1614, then the site of a Dutch trading post, and had 
secured a cargo of skins with which he was about to return to Holland, when
a fire consumed both his vessel and her cargo, and obliged him to pass the 
winter with his crew on the island.&nbsp; They built them log huts on the 
site of the present Beaver street, the first houses erected in New York, 
and during the winter constructed a yacht of sixteen tons, which Block 
called the <i>Onrust</i>&mdash;the &ldquo;Restless.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this 
yacht Block made many voyages of discovery, exploring the coasts of Long 
Island Sound, and giving his name to the island near the eastern end of the
sound.&nbsp; He soon after went back to Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a small settlement had clustered about the trading post and 
the huts built by Block&rsquo;s shipwrecked crew, and had taken the name of
New Amsterdam.&nbsp; The inhabitants were well suited to become the 
ancestors of a great nation.&nbsp; They were mainly Dutch citizens of a 
European Republic, &ldquo;composed of seven free, sovereign 
States&rdquo;&mdash;made so by a struggle with despotism for forty years, 
and occupying a territory which their ancestors had reclaimed from the 
ocean and morass by indomitable labor.&nbsp; It was a republic where 
freedom of conscience, speech, and the press were complete and 
universal.&nbsp; The effect of this freedom had been the internal 
development of social beauty and strength, and vast increment of 
substantial wealth and power by immigration.&nbsp; Wars and despotisms in 
other parts of Europe sent thousands of intelligent exiles thither, and 
those free provinces were crowded with ingenious mechanics, and artists, 
and learned men, because conscience was there undisturbed, and the hand and
brain were free to win and use the rewards of their industry and 
skill.&nbsp; Beautiful cities, towns, and villages were strewn over the 
whole country, and nowhere <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>in Europe did society present an aspect half as
pleasing as that of Holland.&nbsp; Every religious sect there found an 
asylum from persecution and encouragement to manly effort, by the kind 
respect of all.&nbsp; And at the very time when the charter of the West 
India Company was under consideration, that band of English Puritans who 
afterward set up the ensign of free institutions on the shores of 
Massachusetts Bay, were being nurtured in the bosom of that republic, and 
instructed in those principles of civil liberty that became a salutary 
leaven in the bigotry which they brought with them.</p>

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>&ldquo;Such were the people who laid the foundations of the 
Commonwealth of New York.&nbsp; They were men of expanded views, liberal 
feelings, and never dreamed of questioning any man&rsquo;s inalienable 
right to &lsquo;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&rsquo; among 
them, whether he first inspired the common air in Holland, England, 
Abyssinia, or Kamtschatka.&nbsp; And as the population increased and became
heterogeneous, that very toleration became a reproach; and their Puritan 
neighbors on the east, and Churchmen and Romanists on the south, called New
Amsterdam &lsquo;a cage of unclean birds.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The English, now awake to the importance of Hudson&rsquo;s discoveries, 
warned the Dutch Government to refrain from making further settlements on 
&ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River,&rdquo; as they called the Mauritius; but the 
latter, relying upon the justice of their claim, which was based upon 
Hudson&rsquo;s discovery, paid no attention to these warnings, and in the 
spring of 1623 the Dutch West India Company sent over thirty families of 
Walloons, or 110 persons in all, to found a permanent colony at New 
Amsterdam, which, until now, had been inhabited only by fur traders.&nbsp; 
These Walloons were Protestants, from the frontier between France and 
Flanders, and had fled to Amsterdam to escape religious persecution in 
France.&nbsp; They were sound, healthy, vigorous, and pious people, and 
could be relied upon to make homes in the New World.&nbsp; The majority of 
them settled in New Amsterdam.&nbsp; Others went to Long Island, where 
Sarah de Rapelje, the first white child born in the province of New 
Netherlands, saw the light.</p>
<p>In 1626, Peter Minuit, the first regular Governor, was sent over from 
Holland.&nbsp; He brought with him a <i>Koopman</i> or general commissary, 
who was also secretary of the province, and a <i>Schout</i>, or sheriff, to
assist him in his government.&nbsp; The only laws to which he was subject 
were the instructions of the West India Company.&nbsp; The colonists, on 
their part, were to regard his will as their law.&nbsp; He set to work with
great vigor to lay the foundations of the colony.&nbsp; He called a council
of the Indian chiefs, and purchased the Island of Manhattan from <!-- page 
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>them for 
presents valued at about twenty dollars, United States coin.&nbsp; He thus 
secured an equitable title to the island, and won the friendship of the 
Indians.&nbsp; Under his vigorous administration, the colony prospered; 
houses were built, farms laid off; the population was largely increased by 
new arrivals from Europe; and New Amsterdam fairly entered upon its career 
as one of the most important places in America.&nbsp; It was a happy 
settlement, as well; the rights of the people were respected, and they were
as free as they had been in Holland.&nbsp; Troubles with the Indians marked
the close of Minuit&rsquo;s administration.&nbsp; The latter were provoked 
by the murder of some of their number by the whites, and by the aid 
rendered by the commander at Fort Orange (Albany) to the Mohegans, in one 
of their forays upon the Mohawks.&nbsp; Many of the families at Fort 
Orange, and from the region between the Hudson and the Delaware, abandoned 
their settlements, and came to New Amsterdam for safety, thus adding to the
population of that place.&nbsp; Minuit was recalled in 1632, and he left 
the province in a highly prosperous condition.&nbsp; During the last year 
of his government New Amsterdam sent over $60,000 worth of furs to 
Holland.</p>
<p>His successor was the redoubtable Wouter Van Twiller, a clerk in the 
company&rsquo;s warehouse at Amsterdam, who owed his appointment to his 
being the husband of the niece of Killian Van Rensselaer, the patroon of 
Albany.&nbsp; Irving has given us the following admirable portrait of 
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was exactly five feet six inches in height, and six feet five 
inches in circumference.&nbsp; His head was a perfect sphere, and of such 
stupendous dimensions, that dame Nature, with all her sex&rsquo;s 
ingenuity, would have been puzzled to construct a neck capable of 
supporting it; wherefore she wisely declined the attempt, and settled it 
firmly on the top of his back bone, just between the shoulders.&nbsp; His 
body was oblong, and particularly capacious at bottom; which was wisely 
ordered by Providence, seeing that he was a man of sedentary habits, and 
very averse to the idle labor of walking.&nbsp; His legs were very short, 
but sturdy in proportion to the weight they had to sustain: so that, when 
erect, he had not a little the appearance of a beer barrel on skids.&nbsp; 
His face, that infallible index of the <!-- page 40--><a 
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>mind, presented a vast 
expanse, unfurrowed by any of those lines and angles which disfigure the 
human countenance with what is termed expression.&nbsp; Two small gray eyes
twinkled feebly in the midst, like two stars of lesser magnitude in a hazy 
firmament; and his full-fed cheeks, which seemed to have taken toll of 
everything that went into his mouth, were curiously mottled and streaked 
with dusky red, like a Spitzenberg apple.&nbsp; His habits were as regular 
as his person.&nbsp; He daily took his four stated meals, appropriating 
exactly an hour to each; he smoked and doubted eight hours, and he slept 
the remaining twelve of the four-and-twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Twiller ruled the province seven years, and, in spite of his 
stupidity, it prospered.&nbsp; In 1633, Adam Roelantsen, the first 
school-master, arrived&mdash;for the fruitful Walloons had opened the way 
by this time for his labors&mdash;and in the same year a wooden church was 
built in the present Bridge street, and placed in charge of the famous 
Dominie Everardus Bogardus.&nbsp; In 1635, the fort, which marked the site 
of the present Bowling Green, and which had been begun in 1614, was 
finished, and in the same year the first English settlers at New Amsterdam 
came into the town.&nbsp; The English in New England also began to give the
Dutch trouble during this administration, and even sent a ship into 
&ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River&rdquo; to trade with the Indians.&nbsp; 
Influenced by De Vries, the commander of the fort, the Governor sent an 
expedition up the river after the audacious English vessel, seized her, 
brought her back to New York, and sent her to sea with a warning not to 
repeat her attempt.&nbsp; The disputes between the English and the Dutch 
about the Connecticut settlements, also began to make trouble for New 
Amsterdam.&nbsp; Van Twiller possessed no influence in the colony, was 
laughed at and snubbed on every side, and was at length recalled by the 
company in 1638.&nbsp; The only memorial of Van Twiller left to us is the 
Isle of Nuts, which lies in the bay between New York and Brooklyn, and 
which he purchased as his private domain.&nbsp; It is still called the 
&ldquo;Governor&rsquo;s Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Twiller&rsquo;s successor in the government of the province <!-- 
page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>was 
William Kieft.&nbsp; He was as energetic as he was spiteful, and as 
spiteful as he was rapacious.&nbsp; His chief pleasure lay in 
quarrelling.&nbsp; He and his council made some useful reforms, but as a 
rule they greatly oppressed the people.&nbsp; During this administration 
agriculture was encouraged, the growing of fruit was undertaken, and 
several other things done to increase the material prosperity of the 
town.&nbsp; The fort was repaired and strengthened, new warehouses were 
built, and police ordinances were framed and strictly executed.&nbsp; The 
old wooden church was made a barrack for troops, and a new and larger 
edifice of stone was constructed by Kuyter and Dam within the walls of the 
fort.&nbsp; Within the little tower were hung the bells captured from the 
Spanish by the Dutch at Porto Rico.&nbsp; The church cost $1000, and was 
considered a grand edifice.&nbsp; In 1642 a stone tavern was built at the 
head of Coenties Slip, and in the same year, the first &ldquo;city 
lots&rdquo; with valid titles were granted to the settlers.</p>
<p>The latter part of Kieft&rsquo;s administration was marked by contests 
with the citizens, who compelled him, in 1641, to grant them a municipal 
council, composed of twelve of the most prominent residents of New 
Amsterdam, which council he arbitrarily dissolved at the first 
opportunity.&nbsp; He also stirred up a war with the Indians, in which he 
was the principal aggressor.&nbsp; This war brought great loss and 
suffering upon the province, and came near ruining it.&nbsp; Kieft, alarmed
at the results of his folly, appointed a new municipal council of eight 
members, and this council at once demanded of the States General of Holland
the removal of Kieft.&nbsp; Their demand was complied with, and in 1647, 
Peter Stuyvesant was made Governor of New Netherlands, and reached New 
Amsterdam in the same year.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant was essentially a strong man.&nbsp; A soldier by education 
and of long experience, he was accustomed to regard rigid discipline as the
one thing needful in every relation of life, and he was not slow to 
introduce that system into his government of New Amsterdam.&nbsp; He had 
served gallantly in the wars against the Portuguese, and had lost a leg in 
one of his numerous encounters with them.&nbsp; He was as vain as a 
peacock, as fond <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>of display as a child, and thoroughly imbued 
with the most aristocratic ideas&mdash;qualities not exactly the best for a
Governor of New Amsterdam.&nbsp; Yet, he was, with all his faults, an 
honest man, he had deeply at heart the interests of the colony, and his 
administration was mainly a prosperous one.</p>
<p>He energetically opposed from the first all manifestations in favor of 
popular government.&nbsp; His will was to be the law of the province.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If any one,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;during my administration shall 
appeal, I will make him a foot shorter, and send the pieces to Holland, and
let him appeal in that way.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went to work with vigor to 
reform matters in the colony, extending his efforts to even the morals and 
domestic affairs of the people.&nbsp; He soon brought about a reign of 
material prosperity greater than had ever been known before, and exerted 
himself to check the encroachments of the English, on the East, and the 
Swedes, on the South.&nbsp; He inaugurated a policy of kindness and justice
toward the Indians, and soon changed their enmity to sincere 
friendship.&nbsp; One thing, however, he dared not do&mdash;he could not 
levy taxes upon the people without their consent, for fear of offending the
States General of Holland.&nbsp; This forced him to appoint a council of 
nine prominent citizens, and, although he endeavored to hedge round their 
powers by numerous conditions, the nine ever afterwards served as a 
salutary check upon the action of the Governor.&nbsp; He succeeded, in the 
autumn of 1650, in settling the boundary disputes with the English in New 
England, and then turned his attention to the Swedes on the Delaware, whom 
he conquered in 1654.&nbsp; His politic course towards them had the effect 
of converting them into warm friends of the Dutch.&nbsp; During his absence
on this expedition, the Indians ravaged the Jersey shore and Staten Island,
and even made an attack on New Amsterdam itself.&nbsp; They were defeated 
by the citizens, and Stuyvesant&rsquo;s speedy return compelled them to 
make peace.&nbsp; This was the last blow struck by the savages at the 
infant metropolis.</p>
<p>In 1652, the States General, much to the disgust of Stuyvesant, granted 
to New Amsterdam a municipal government similar to that of the free cities 
of Holland.&nbsp; A Schout, or <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Sheriff, two Burgomasters, and five Schepens, 
were to constitute a municipal court of justice.&nbsp; The people, however,
were denied the selection of these officers, who were appointed by the 
Governor.&nbsp; In February, 1653, these officers were formally 
installed.&nbsp; They were, Schout Van Tienhoven, Burgomasters Hattem and 
Kregier, and Schepens Van der Grist, Van Gheel, Anthony, Beeckman, and 
Couwenhoven, with Jacob Kip as clerk.</p>
<p>During Stuyvesant&rsquo;s administration, the colony received large 
accessions from the English in New England.&nbsp; &ldquo;Numbers, nay whole
towns,&rdquo; says De Laet, &ldquo;to escape from the insupportable 
government of New England, removed to New Netherlands, to enjoy that 
liberty denied to them by their own countrymen.&rdquo;&nbsp; They settled 
in New Amsterdam, on Long Island, and in Westchester county.&nbsp; Being 
admitted to the rights of citizenship, they exercised considerable 
influence in the affairs of the colony, and towards the close of his 
administration gave the Governor considerable trouble by their opposition 
to his despotic acts.</p>
<p>In 1647, the streets of New Amsterdam were cleared of the shanties and 
pig-pens which obstructed them.&nbsp; In 1648, every Monday was declared a 
market-day.&nbsp; In 1650, Dirk Van Schellyne, the first lawyer, &ldquo;put
up his shingle&rdquo; in New Amsterdam.&nbsp; In 1652, a wall or palisade 
was erected along the upper boundary of the city, in apprehension of an 
invasion by the English.&nbsp; This defence ran from river to river, and to
it Wall street, which occupies its site east of Trinity Church, owes its 
name.&nbsp; In 1656, the first survey of the city was made, and seventeen 
streets were laid down on the map; and, in the same year, the first census 
showed a &ldquo;city&rdquo; of 120 houses, and 1000 inhabitants.&nbsp; In 
1657, a terrible blow fell upon New Amsterdam&mdash;the public treasury 
being empty, the salary of the town drummer could not be paid.&nbsp; In 
that year the average price of the best city lots was $50.&nbsp; In 1658, 
the custom of &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; received its death blow by an edict of
the Governor, which forbade men and women to live together until legally 
married.&nbsp; In that year the streets were first paved with stone, and 
the first &ldquo;night watch&rdquo; was organized and duly provided with 
rattles.&nbsp; <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>A fire department, supplied with buckets and ladders, was also 
established, and the first public well was dug in Broadway.&nbsp; In 1660, 
it was made the duty of the Sheriff to go round the city by night to assure
himself of its peace and safety.&nbsp; This worthy official complained that
the dogs, having no respect for his august person, attacked him in his 
rounds, and that certain evil-minded individuals &ldquo;frightened&rdquo; 
him by calling out &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; in the darkness, and that even the
boys cut <i>Koeckies</i>.&nbsp; The city grew steadily, its suburbs began 
to smile with boweries, or farms, and in 1658 a palisaded village called 
New Harlem was founded at the eastern end of Manhattan Island for the 
purpose of &ldquo;promoting agriculture, and affording a place of amusement
for the citizens of New Amsterdam.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Homes, genuine, 
happy Dutch homes, in abundance, were found within and without the city, 
where uncultured minds and affectionate hearts enjoyed life in dreamy, 
quiet blissfulness, unknown in these bustling times.&nbsp; The city people 
then rose at dawn, dined at eleven, and went to bed at sunset, except on 
extraordinary occasions, such as Christmas Eve, a tea party, or a 
wedding.&nbsp; Then those who attended the fashionable soir&eacute;es of 
the &lsquo;upper ten&rsquo; assembled at three o&rsquo;clock in the 
afternoon, and went away at six, so that daughter Maritchie might have the 
pewter plates and delf teapot cleaned and cupboarded in time for evening 
prayer at seven.&nbsp; Knitting and spinning held the places of whist and 
flirting in these &lsquo;degenerate days;&rsquo; and <i>utility</i> was as 
plainly stamped on all their pleasures as the maker&rsquo;s name on our 
silver spoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the period of Dutch supremacy on Manhattan was approaching its 
close.&nbsp; Charles II. had just regained the English throne.&nbsp; In 
1664, with characteristic disregard of right and justice, he granted to his
brother James, Duke of York and Albany, the whole territory of New 
Netherlands, including all of Long Island and a part of 
Connecticut&mdash;lands to which he had not the shadow of a claim.&nbsp; In
the same year, a force of four ships and 450 soldiers, under the command of
Colonel Richard Nicholls, was sent to New Amsterdam to take possession of 
that city.&nbsp; It arrived at the Narrows about the 29th of August, and on
the 30th, Nicholls demanded the surrender of the town.&nbsp; <!-- page 
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Stuyvesant, who
had made preparations for defending the place, endeavored to resist the 
demand, but the people refused to sustain him, and he was obliged to 
submit.&nbsp; On the 8th of September, 1664, he withdrew the Dutch garrison
from the fort, and embarked at the foot of Beaver street for Holland.&nbsp;
The English at once took possession of the town and province, changing the 
name of both to New York, in honor of the new proprietor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p45.jpg">
<img alt="New York in 1664" src="images/p45.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The English set themselves to work to conciliate the Dutch residents, a 
task not very difficult, inasmuch as the English settlers already in the 
province had to a great degree prepared the way for the change.&nbsp; In 
1665, the year after the conquest, the city was given a Mayor, a Sheriff, 
and a board of Aldermen, who were charged with the administration of 
municipal affairs, and in the same year jury trials were formally 
established.&nbsp; In July, 1673, the Dutch fleet recaptured the town, 
drove out the English, and named it New Orange.&nbsp; The peace between 
Great Britain and Holland, which closed the war, restored the town to the 
English, November 10th, 1674, and the name of New York was resumed.&nbsp; 
The Dutch Government was replaced by the English system under a liberal 
charter, and during the remainder of the seventeenth century the town grew 
rapidly in <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>population and size.&nbsp; In 1689 there was a brief disturbance 
known as Leislers&rsquo; Rebellion.&nbsp; In 1700 New York contained 750 
dwellings and 4500 white and 750 black inhabitants.&nbsp; In 1693 William 
Bradford established the first printing press in the city.&nbsp; In 1696 
Trinity Church was begun, and in 1697, the streets were first lighted, a 
lamp being hung out upon a pole extending from the window of every seventh 
house.&nbsp; In 1702 a terrible fever was brought from St. Thomas&rsquo;, 
and carried off 600 persons, one-tenth of the whole population.&nbsp; In 
1711, a slave market was established.&nbsp; In 1719 the first Presbyterian 
Church was built; in 1725 the New York <i>Gazette</i>, the fifth of the 
colonial newspapers, was established; and in 1730 stages ran to 
Philadelphia once a fortnight, and in 1732 to Boston, the latter journey 
occupying fourteen days.&nbsp; In 1731 the first public library, the 
bequest of the Rev. Dr.&nbsp; Wellington, of England, was opened in the 
city.&nbsp; It contained 1622 volumes.&nbsp; In 1734 a workhouse was 
erected in the present City Hall Park.&nbsp; In 1735 the people made their 
first manifestation of hostility to Great Britain, which was drawn forth by
the infamous prosecution by the officers of the crown, of Rip Van Dam, who 
had been the acting Governor of the town.&nbsp; The winter of 1740-41 was 
memorable for its severity.&nbsp; The Hudson was frozen over at New York, 
and the snow lay six feet on a level.&nbsp; In 1741, a severe fire in the 
lower part of the city destroyed among other things the old Dutch Church 
and fort, and in the same year the yellow fever raged with great 
violence.&nbsp; The principal event of the year, however, was the so-called
negro plot for the destruction of the town.&nbsp; Though the reality of the
plot was never proved, the greatest alarm prevailed; the fire in the fort 
was declared to be the work of the negroes, many of whom were arrested; and
upon the sole evidence of a servant girl a number of the poor wretches were
convicted and hanged.&nbsp; Several whites were charged with being the 
accomplices of the negroes.&nbsp; One of these, John Ury, a Roman Catholic 
priest, and, as is now believed, an innocent man, was hanged, in 
August.&nbsp; In the space of six months 154 negroes and twenty whites were
arrested, twenty negroes were hanged, thirteen were burned at the stake, 
and seventy-eight were <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>transported.&nbsp; The rest were 
released.&nbsp; In 1750 a theatre was opened, and in 1755 St. Paul&rsquo;s 
Church was erected.&nbsp; In 1754 the &ldquo;Walton House,&rdquo; in Pearl 
street (still standing), was built by William Walton, a merchant.&nbsp; It 
was long known as the finest private residence in the city.&nbsp; In 1755 
the Staten Island ferry, served by means of row boats, was established, and
in the same year Peck Slip was opened and paved.&nbsp; In 1756 the first 
lottery ever seen in the city was opened in behalf of King&rsquo;s (now 
Columbia) College.</p>
<p>New York bore a prominent part in the resistance of the colonies to the 
aggressions of the mother country, and in spite of the efforts of her 
royalist Governor and the presence of a large number of Tories, responded 
cordially to the call of the colonies for men and money during the 
war.&nbsp; On the 14th of April, 1776, the city was occupied by the 
American army, the British force stationed there being obliged to 
withdraw.&nbsp; On the 26th of August, 1776, the battle of Long Island 
having been lost by the Americans, New York was occupied by the British, 
who held it until the close of the war.&nbsp; It suffered very much at 
their hands.&nbsp; Nearly all the churches, except the Episcopal, were used
by them as prisons, riding schools, and stables; and the schools and 
colleges were closed.&nbsp; On the 21st of September, 1776, a fire 
destroyed 493 houses, including Trinity Church&mdash;all the west side of 
Broadway from Whitehall to Barclay street, or about one-eighth of the city;
and on the 7th of August 1778, about 300 buildings on East River were 
burned.&nbsp; The winter of 1779-80 was very severe; there was a beaten 
track for sleighs and wagons across the Hudson; the ice in that river being
strong enough to bear a horse and man as late as the 17th of March; eighty 
sleighs, with provisions, and a large body of troops, crossed on the ice 
from the city to Staten Island.&nbsp; On the 25th of November, 1783, the 
British evacuated the city, which was at once occupied by the American 
army.</p>
<p>In 1785 the first Federal Congress met in the City Hall, which stood at 
the corner of Wall and Nassau streets, and on the 30th of April, 1789, 
George Washington was inaugurated first President of the United States on 
the same spot.&nbsp; By 1791 <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>New York had spread to the lower end of the 
present City Hall Park, the site of the new Post Office, and was extending 
along the Boston road, or Bowery, and Broadway.&nbsp; In 1799, the 
Manhattan Company for supplying the city with fresh water was 
chartered.&nbsp; On the 20th of September, 1803, the cornerstone of the 
City Hall was laid.&nbsp; The city fathers, sagely premising that New York 
would never pass this limit, ordered the rear wall of the edifice to be 
constructed of brown stone, to save the expense of marble.&nbsp; Free 
schools were opened in 1805.&nbsp; In the same year the yellow fever raged 
with violence, and had the effect of extending the city by driving the 
population up the island, where many of them located themselves 
permanently.&nbsp; In 1807, Robert Fulton navigated the first steamboat 
from New York to Albany.</p>
<p>The war of 1812-15 for a while stopped the growth of the city, but after
the return of peace its progress was resumed.&nbsp; In August, 1812, 
experimental gas lamps were placed in the City Hall Park, though the use of
gas for purposes of lighting was not begun until 1825.&nbsp; In 1822 the 
yellow fever again drove the population up the island, and caused a rapid 
growth of the city above Canal street.&nbsp; In 1825 the Erie Canal was 
completed.&nbsp; This great work, by placing the trade of the West in the 
hands of New York, gave a powerful impetus to the growth of the city, which
was at that time spreading at the rate of from 1000 to 1500 houses per 
year.&nbsp; In 1832 and 1834, the cholera raged severely, carrying off 
upwards of 4484 persons in the two years.&nbsp; In 1835, the &ldquo;great 
fire&rdquo; occurred.&nbsp; This terrible conflagration broke out on the 
16th of December of that year, and swept the First Ward of the city east of
Broadway and below Wall street.&nbsp; It laid almost the entire business 
quarter in ashes, destroyed 648 houses, and inflicted upon the city a loss 
of over $18,000,000.&nbsp; New York rose from this disaster with wonderful 
energy and rapidity, but only to meet, in 1837, the most terrible financial
crisis that had ever burst upon the country.&nbsp; Even this did not check 
the growth of the city, the population increasing 110,100 between 1830 and 
1840.&nbsp; In 1842 the Croton water was introduced.&nbsp; In 1849 and 1854
the <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>cholera again appeared, killing over 5400 persons.&nbsp; In 1852, 
the first street railway was built.&nbsp; In 1858, the Central Park was 
begun.</p>
<p>The Civil War checked the growth and trade of the city, which languished
during the entire struggle, but upon the return of peace New York resumed 
its onward progress.&nbsp; The growth of the city since 1865 has been most 
marked, especially in the immediate vicinity of the Central Park.&nbsp; Not
less marked has been the improvement of the older portions.&nbsp; The city 
is rapidly increasing in size, population, and magnificence, and is fully 
maintaining its position as the brilliant metropolis of the New World.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; DESCRIPTIVE AND STATISTICAL.</h3>
<p>The city of New York, the largest and most important in the United 
States, is situated in New York County, on Manhattan Island, at the mouth 
of the Hudson River, eighteen miles from the Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp; The city
limits comprise the entire county of New York, embracing Manhattan Island, 
Randall&rsquo;s, Ward&rsquo;s, and Blackwell&rsquo;s Islands, in the East 
River, and Governor&rsquo;s, Bedloe&rsquo;s, and Ellis&rsquo; Islands, in 
the bay.&nbsp; The last three are occupied by the military posts of the 
United States Government.&nbsp; Manhattan Island is bounded on the north by
Spuyten Duyvel Creek and the Harlem River&mdash;practically the same 
stream; on the east by the East River, on the west by the Hudson, and on 
the south by New York Bay.&nbsp; It is nine miles long on the east side, 
thirteen and a half miles long on the west side, and two and a half miles 
wide at its greatest breadth, the average breadth being a mile and a 
half.&nbsp; It is but a few feet in width at its southern extremity, but 
spreads out like a fan as it stretches away to the northward.&nbsp; The 
southern point is but a few inches above the level of the bay, but the 
island rises rapidly to the northward, its extreme northern portion being 
occupied by a series of bold, finely wooded heights, which <!-- page 
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>terminate at 
the junction of the Hudson River and Spuyten Duyvel Creek, in a bold 
promontory, 130 feet high.&nbsp; These hills, known as Washington Heights, 
are two or three miles in length.&nbsp; The southern portion of the island 
is principally a sand-bed, but the remainder is very rocky.&nbsp; The 
island covers an area of twenty-two square miles, or 14,000 acres.&nbsp; It
is built up compactly for about six miles, along the east side, and 
irregularly to Harlem, three miles farther.&nbsp; Along the west side it is
built up compactly to the Central Park, Fifty-ninth street, and irregularly
to Manhattanville, One hundred and twenty-fifth street, from which point to
Spuyten Duyvel Creek it is covered with country seats, gardens, etc.&nbsp; 
Three wagon, and two railroad bridges over the Harlem River connect the 
island with the mainland, and numerous lines of ferries afford 
communication with Long and Staten Islands, and New Jersey.&nbsp; The 
island attains its greatest width at Fourteenth and Eighty-seventh 
streets.</p>
<p>The city is finely built, and presents an aspect of industry and 
liveliness unsurpassed by any place in the world.&nbsp; Lying in full sight
of the ocean, with its magnificent bay to the southward, and the East and 
Hudson Rivers washing its shores, the city of New York possesses a climate 
which renders it the most delightful residence in America.&nbsp; In the 
winter the proximity of the sea moderates the severity of the cold, and in 
the summer the heat is tempered by the delightful sea breezes which sweep 
over the island.&nbsp; Snow seldom lies in the streets for more than a few 
hours, and the intense &ldquo;heated terms&rdquo; of the summer are of very
brief duration.&nbsp; As a natural consequence, the city is healthy, and 
the death rate, considering the population, is small.</p>
<p>The southern portion is densely built up.&nbsp; Between the City Hall 
and Twenty-third street New York is more thickly populated than any city in
America.&nbsp; It is in this section that the &ldquo;tenement 
houses,&rdquo; or buildings containing from five to twenty families, are to
be found.&nbsp; The greatest mortality is in these over-crowded districts, 
which the severest police measures cannot keep clean and free from 
filth.&nbsp; The southern portion of the city is devoted almost exclusively
to trade, comparatively few <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>persons residing below the City Hall.&nbsp; 
Below Canal street the streets are narrow, crooked, and irregular.&nbsp; 
Above Houston street they are broad and straight, and are laid out at 
regular intervals.&nbsp; Above Houston street, the streets extending across
the island are numbered.&nbsp; The avenues begin in the vicinity of Third 
street, and extend, or will extend to the northern limit of the island, 
running parallel with the Hudson River.&nbsp; There are twelve fine avenues
at parallel distances apart of about 800 feet.&nbsp; Second and Eighth are 
the longest, and Fifth, Madison and Lexington the most fashionable.&nbsp; 
They commence with Avenue D, a short street, near the East River.&nbsp; 
West of this, and parallel with it, are three avenues somewhat longer, 
called Avenues C, B, and A, the last being the most westerly.&nbsp; Then 
begin the long avenues, which are numbered First, Second, and so on, as 
they increase to the westward.&nbsp; There are two other avenues shorter 
than those with numbers, viz: Lexington, lying between Third and Fourth, 
and extending from Fourteenth street on the south to Sixty-ninth street on 
the north; and Madison, between Fourth and Fifth, and extending from 
Twenty-third street at Madison Square to Eighty-sixth street.&nbsp; Madison
and Lexington are each to be prolonged to the Harlem River.&nbsp; These 
avenues are all 100 feet wide, except Lexington and Madison, which are 
seventy-five feet wide, and Fourth avenue, above Thirty-fourth street, 
which is 140 feet wide.&nbsp; Third avenue is the main street on the east 
side above the Bowery, of which it is a continuation, and Eighth avenue is 
the principal highway on the west side.&nbsp; Fifth and Madison avenues are
the most fashionable, and are magnificently built up with private 
residences below the Park.&nbsp; The cross streets connecting them are also
handsomely built.</p>
<p>The numerical streets are all sixty feet wide, except Fourteenth, 
Twenty-third, Thirty-fourth, Forty-second, and eleven others north of 
these, which are 100 feet wide.&nbsp; The streets of the city are well laid
off, and are paved with an excellent quality of stone.&nbsp; The sidewalks 
generally consist of immense stone &ldquo;flags.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the lower 
part of the city, in the poorer and business sections, the streets are 
dirty and always out of order.&nbsp; <!-- page 52--><a 
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>In the upper part they 
are clean, and are generally kept so by private contributions.</p>
<p>The avenues on the eastern and western extremities of the city are the 
abodes of poverty and want, and often of vice, hemming in the wealthy and 
cleanly sections on both sides.&nbsp; Poverty and riches are close 
neighbors in New York.&nbsp; Only a stone&rsquo;s throw back of the most 
sumptuous parts of Broadway and Fifth avenue, want and suffering, vice and 
crime, hold their courts.&nbsp; Fine ladies can look down from their high 
casements upon the squalid dens of their unfortunate sisters.</p>
<p>Broadway is the principal thoroughfare.&nbsp; It extends from the 
Battery to Spuyten Duyvel Creek, a distance of fifteen miles.&nbsp; It is 
built up compactly for about five miles, is paved and graded for about 
seven miles, and is lighted with gas along its entire length.&nbsp; There 
are over 420 miles of streets in the patrol districts, and eleven miles of 
piers along the water.&nbsp; The sewerage is generally good, but defective 
in some places.&nbsp; Nearly 400 miles of water-mains have been laid.&nbsp;
The streets are lighted by about 19,000 gas lamps, besides lamps set out by
private parties.&nbsp; They are paved with the Belgian and wooden 
pavements, cobble stones being almost a thing of the past.&nbsp; For so 
large a city, New York is remarkably clean, except in those portions lying 
close to the river, or given up to paupers.</p>
<p>The city is substantially built.&nbsp; Frame houses are rare.&nbsp; Many
of the old quarters are built of brick, but this material is now used to a 
limited extent only.&nbsp; Broadway and the principal business streets are 
lined with buildings of iron, marble, granite, brown, Portland, and Ohio 
stone, palatial in their appearance; and the sections devoted to the 
residences of the better classes are built up mainly with brown, Portland, 
and Ohio stone, and in some instances with marble.&nbsp; Thus the city 
presents an appearance of grandeur and solidity most pleasing to the 
eye.&nbsp; The public buildings will compare favorably with any in the 
world, and there is no city on the globe that can boast so many palatial 
warehouses and stores.&nbsp; Broadway is one of the best built 
thoroughfares in the world.&nbsp; The stores which line it are generally 
from five to six stories high above ground, <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>with two cellars below 
the pavement, and vaults extending to near the middle of the street.&nbsp; 
The adjacent streets in many instances rival Broadway in their 
splendors.&nbsp; The stores of the city are famous for their elegance and 
convenience, and for the magnificence and variety of the goods displayed in
them.&nbsp; The streets occupied by private residences are broad, clean and
well-paved, and are lined with miles of dwellings inferior to none in the 
world in convenience and substantial elegance.&nbsp; The amount of wealth 
and taste concentrated in the dwellings of the better classes of the 
citizens of New York is very great.</p>

54</span>The population of New York, in 1870, according to the United 
States census of that year, was 942,337.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that 
at the present time the island contains over 1,000,000 
<i>residents</i>.&nbsp; Thousands of persons doing business in New York 
reside in the vicinity, and enter and leave the city at morning and 
evening, and thousands of strangers, on business and pleasure, come and go 
daily.&nbsp; It is estimated that the actual number of people in the city 
about the hour of noon is nearly, if not fully, one million and a 
half.&nbsp; According to the census of 1870, the actual population 
consisted of 929,199 white and 13,153 colored persons.&nbsp; The native 
population was 523,238, and the foreign population 419,094.&nbsp; The 
nationality of the principal part of the foreign element was as

<p>Besides those mentioned in this table, are representatives of <!-- page 
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>every 
nationality under heaven, in greater or less strength.&nbsp; It will be 
seen that the native population is in the excess.&nbsp; The increase of 
natives between 1860 and 1870, was 93,246.&nbsp; The Germans increased in 
the same period at the rate of 32,936; while the Irish population fell off 
1701 in the same decade.&nbsp; The foreign classes frequently herd together
by themselves, in distinct parts of the city, which they seem to regard as 
their own.&nbsp; In some sections are to be found whole streets where the 
inhabitants do not understand English, having no occasion to use it in 
their daily life.</p>
<p>In 1869, there were 13,947 births, 8695 marriages, and 24,601 deaths 
reported by the city authorities.&nbsp; The authorities stated that they 
were satisfied that the number of births was actually over 30,000; the 
number reported by them being very incomplete, owing to the difficulty of 
procuring such information.</p>
<p>Its mixed population makes New York a thoroughly cosmopolitan city, yet 
at the same time it is eminently American.&nbsp; The native element 
exercises a controlling influence upon all its acts, and when the proper 
exertion is made rarely fails to maintain its ascendancy.</p>
<p>The number of buildings in the city is from 60,000 to 70,000.&nbsp; In 
1860, out of 161,000 families only 15,000 occupied entire houses.&nbsp; 
Nine thousand one hundred and twenty dwellings contained two families each,
and 6100 contained three families each.&nbsp; After these come the tenement
houses.&nbsp; At present, the number of houses occupied by more than one 
family is even larger.</p>
<p>It has been well said that &ldquo;New York is the best place in the 
world to take the conceit out of a man.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is true.&nbsp; No
matter how great or flattering is the local reputation of an individual, he
finds upon reaching New York that he is entirely unknown.&nbsp; He must at 
once set to work to build up a reputation here, where he will be taken for 
just what he is worth, and no more.&nbsp; The city is a good school for 
studying human nature, and its people are proficients in the art of 
discerning character.</p>
<p>In point of morality, the people of New York, in spite of all that has 
been said of them, compare favorably with those of any other city.&nbsp; If
the darkest side of life is to be seen here, one <!-- page 56--><a 
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>may also witness the 
best.&nbsp; The greatest scoundrels and the purest Christians are to be 
found here.&nbsp; It is but natural that New York, being the great centre 
of wealth, should also be the great centre of all that is good and 
beautiful in life.&nbsp; It is true that the Devil&rsquo;s work is done 
here on a gigantic scale, but the will of the Lord is done on an equally 
great, if not a greater scale.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In its charities, New York stands at the head of American 
communities&mdash;the great heart of the city throbs warmly for suffering 
humanity.&nbsp; The municipal authorities expend annually about one million
of dollars in public charities.&nbsp; The various <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>religious denominations
spend annually about five millions more, and private benevolence disburses 
a sum of which no record is to be had&mdash;but it is large.&nbsp; Besides 
this, the city is constantly sending out princely sums to relieve want and 
suffering in all parts of our broad land.&nbsp; New York never turns a deaf
ear to an appeal for aid.</p>
<p>The people of New York are very liberal in matters of opinion.&nbsp; 
Here, as a general rule, no man seeks to influence the belief of another, 
except so far as all men are privileged to do so.&nbsp; Every religious 
faith, every shade of political opinion, is protected and finds full 
expression.&nbsp; Men concern themselves with their own affairs only.&nbsp;
Indeed this feeding has been carried to such an extreme that it has 
engendered a decided indifference between man and man.&nbsp; People live 
for years as next door neighbors without ever knowing each other by 
sight.&nbsp; A gentleman once happened to notice the name of his next door 
neighbor on the door-plate.&nbsp; To his surprise he found it the same as 
his own.&nbsp; Accosting the owner of the door-plate one day, for the first
time, he remarked that it was singular that two people bearing the same 
name should live side by side for years without knowing each other.&nbsp; 
This remark led to mutual inquiries and statements, and to their surprise 
the two men found they were brothers&mdash;sons of the same parents.&nbsp; 
They had not met for many years, and for fully twelve years had lived side 
by side as neighbors, without knowing each other.&nbsp; This incident may 
be overdrawn, but it will illustrate a peculiar feature of New York 
life.</p>
<p>Strangers coming to New York are struck with the fact that there are but
two classes in the city&mdash;the poor and the rich.&nbsp; The middle 
class, which is so numerous in other cities, hardly exists at all 
here.&nbsp; The reason of this is plain to the initiated.&nbsp; Living in 
New York is so expensive that persons of moderate means reside in the 
suburbs, some of them as far as forty miles in the country.&nbsp; They come
into the city, to their business, in crowds, between the hours of seven and
nine in the morning, and literally pour out of it between four and seven in
the evening.&nbsp; In fair weather the inconvenience of such a life is 
trifling, but in the winter it is absolutely fearful.&nbsp; A deep snow 
will sometimes <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>obstruct the railroad tracks, and persons living outside of the 
city are either unable to leave New York or are forced to spend the night 
on the cars.&nbsp; Again, the rivers will be so full of floating ice as to 
render it very dangerous, if not impossible, for the ferry boats to 
cross.&nbsp; At such times the railroad depots and ferry houses are crowded
with persons anxiously awaiting transportation to their homes.&nbsp; The 
detention in New York, however, is not the greatest inconvenience caused by
such mishaps.</p>
<p>To persons of means, New York offers more advantages as a place of 
residence than any city in the land.&nbsp; Its delightful climate, its 
cosmopolitan and metropolitan character, and the endless variety of its 
attractions and comforts, render it the most delightful home in 
America.&nbsp; Its people are warmly attached to and proud of it, and even 
strangers feel drawn towards it as to no other city save their own 
homes.&nbsp; Few persons care to leave it after a twelve-months&rsquo; 
residence within its limits, and those who are forced to go away generally 
find their way back at the earliest opportunity.</p>

59</span>II.&nbsp; THE HARBOR OF NEW YORK.</h2>
<p>The bay and harbor of New York are noted the world over for their 
beauty.&nbsp; When the discoverer, Henry Hudson, first gazed upon the 
glorious scene, he gave vent to the impulsive assertion that it was 
&ldquo;a very good land to fall in with, and a pleasant land to see,&rdquo;
and there are few who will venture to differ from him.</p>
<p>To enjoy the wonderful beauty of the bay, one should enter it from the 
ocean; and it is from the blue water that we propose to begin our 
exploration.</p>
<p>Nineteen miles from the City of New York, on the western side of the 
bay, is a low, narrow, and crooked neck of sand, covered in some places 
with a dense growth of pine and other hardy trees.&nbsp; This neck is 
called Sandy Hook, and its curve encloses a pretty little bay, known as the
Cove.&nbsp; On the extreme end of the point, which commands the main ship 
channel, the General Government is erecting a powerful fort, under the guns
of which every vessel entering the bay must pass.&nbsp; There is also a 
lighthouse near the fort, and within the last few years a railway depot has
been built on the shore of the Cove.&nbsp; Passengers from New York for 
Long Branch are transferred from the steamer to the cars at this place, the
road running along the sea-shore to Long Branch.&nbsp; To the westward of 
Sandy Hook, on the Jersey shore, are the finely wooded and picturesque 
Highlands of Nevesink, and at their feet the Shrewsbury River flows into 
the bay, while some miles to the eastward are the shining sands and white 
houses of Rockaway Beach and Fire Island.&nbsp; Seven miles out at sea, 
tosses the Sandy Hook Light Ship, marking the point from which vessels must
take their course in entering the bay.</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>Leaving Sandy Hook, our course is a little to the northwest.&nbsp;
The New Jersey shore is on our left, and we can see the dim outlines of 
Port Monmouth and Perth Amboy and South Amboy in the far distance, while to
the right Coney Island and its hotels are in full sight.&nbsp; Back of 
these lie the low shores of Long Island, dotted with pretty suburban villas
and villages.&nbsp; A few miles above Sandy Hook we pass the Quarantine 
station in the Lower Bay, with the fleet of detained vessels clustering 
about the hospital ships.</p>

<img alt="THE HARBOR OF NEW YORK, AS SEEN FROM THE NARROWS" 
src="images/p60.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Straight ahead, on our left, is a bold headland, sloping away from east 
to west, towards the Jersey coast.&nbsp; This is Staten Island, a favorite 
resort for New Yorkers, and taken up mainly with their handsome country 
seats.&nbsp; The bay here narrows rapidly, and the shores of Staten and 
Long Islands are scarcely a mile apart.&nbsp; This passage is famous the 
world over as <i>The Narrows</i>, and connects the Inner and Lower 
Bays.&nbsp; The shores are high on either side, but the Staten Island side 
is a bold <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>headland, the summit of which is over one hundred feet above the 
water.&nbsp; These high shores constitute the protection which the Inner 
Bay enjoys from the storms that howl along the coast.&nbsp; It is to them 
also that New York must look for protection in the event of a foreign 
war.&nbsp; Here are the principal fortifications of the city, and whichever
way we turn the shores bristle with guns.&nbsp; On the Long Island shore is
Fort Hamilton, an old but powerful work, begun in 1824, and completed in 
1832, at a cost of $550,000.&nbsp; The main work mounts eighty heavy guns; 
but since the Civil War, additional batteries, some of them armed with 
Rodman guns, have been erected.&nbsp; A little above Fort Hamilton, and a 
few hundred yards from the shore, is Fort Lafayette, built on a shoal known
as Hendricks&rsquo; Reef.&nbsp; It was begun during the war of 1812, cost 
$350,000, and was armed with seventy-three guns.&nbsp; It was used during 
the Civil War as a jail for political prisoners.&nbsp; In December, 1868, 
it was destroyed by fire, and the Government is now rebuilding it upon a 
more formidable scale.&nbsp; The Staten Island shore is lined with 
guns.&nbsp; At the water&rsquo;s edge is a powerful casemated battery, 
known as Fort Tompkins, mounting forty heavy guns.&nbsp; The bluff above is
crowned with a large and formidable looking work, also of granite, known as
Fort Richmond, mounting one hundred and forty guns.&nbsp; To the right and 
left of the fort, are Batteries Hudson, Morton, North Cliff, and South 
Cliff; mounting about eighty guns of heavy calibre.&nbsp; It is stated that
the new work on Sandy Hook will be armed with two hundred guns, which will 
make the defensive armament of the Lower Bay and Narrows over six hundred 
and thirteen guns, which, together with the fleet of war vessels that could
be assembled for the protection of the city, would render the capture of 
New York by an enemy&rsquo;s fleet a hazardous, if not impracticable, 
undertaking.</p>
<p>Passing through <i>The Narrows</i>, we enter the Inner Bay.&nbsp; New 
York, Brooklyn and Jersey City are in full sight to the northward, with the
Hudson stretching away in the distance.&nbsp; The bay is crowded with 
shipping of all kinds, from the fussy little tug-boat to the large, 
grim-looking man-of-war.&nbsp; As we sail on, the scene becomes more 
animated.&nbsp; On the left are the <!-- page 62--><a 
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>picturesque heights of 
Staten Island, dotted thickly with country-seats, cottages, and pretty 
towns, and on the left the heavily-wooded shores of Long Island abound with
handsome villas.</p>
<p>Soon Staten Island is passed, and we see the white lighthouse standing 
out in the water, which marks the entrance to the Kill Van Kull, or Staten 
Island Sound; and, far to the westward, we can faintly discern the shipping
at Elizabethport.&nbsp; We are now fairly in the harbor of New York, with 
the great city directly in front of us, Brooklyn on our right, and Jersey 
City on our left.&nbsp; To the northward, the line of the Hudson melts away
in the distant blue sky, and to the right the East River is lost in the 
shipping and houses of the two cities it separates.&nbsp; The scene is gay 
and brilliant.&nbsp; The breeze is fresh and delightful; the sky as clear 
and blue as that of Italy, and the bay as bright and beautiful as that of 
Naples, and even more majestic.&nbsp; As far as the eye can reach on either
side of the Hudson extend the long lines of shipping, while the East River 
is a perfect forest of masts.&nbsp; Here are steamboats and steamships, 
sailing vessels, barges, and canal boats&mdash;every sort of craft known to
navigation.&nbsp; The harbor is gay with the flags of all nations.&nbsp; 
Dozens of ferry boats are crossing and recrossing from New York to the 
opposite shores.&nbsp; Ships are constantly entering and leaving port, and 
the whole scene bears the impress of the energy and activity that have made
New York the metropolis of America.</p>
<p>At night the scene is indescribably beautiful.&nbsp; The myriad stars in
the sky above are reflected in the dark bosom of the harbor.&nbsp; The dim 
outlines of the shores are made more distinct by the countless rows of 
lights that line them, and the many colored lamps of the ferry-boats, as 
they dart back and forth over the waters, give to the scene a sort of gala 
appearance.</p>
<p>There are several islands in the harbor, which have been entirely given 
up to the United States Government for military purposes.&nbsp; The largest
of these is Governor&rsquo;s Island, formerly the property of the 
redoubtable Wouter Van Twiller, and still called after him.&nbsp; It lies 
midway between New York and Brooklyn, at the mouth of the East River.&nbsp;
It embraces an area of seventy-two acres, and is one of the principal 
military posts in <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the harbor.&nbsp; Fort Columbus, in the centre 
of the island, is the principal work.&nbsp; Castle William, on the west 
end, is a semi-circular work, with three tiers of guns.&nbsp; Two strong 
batteries defend the passage known as Buttermilk Channel, between the 
island and Brooklyn.&nbsp; In the early days of the Dutch colony, this 
passage could be forded by cattle; now it is passable by ships of 
war.&nbsp; These works are armed with upwards of 200 heavy guns.&nbsp; 
Ellis Island, 2050 yards southwest from the Battery Light-House, contains 
Fort Gibson, mounting about twenty guns.&nbsp; Bedloe&rsquo;s Island, 2950 
yards southwest of the Battery Light-House, contains Fort Wood, which is 
armed with eighty guns.</p>
<p>The best point from which to view the Inner Bay is the Battery Park, 
from the sea-wall of which an uninterrupted view of the bay and both rivers
may be obtained.</p>
<h2><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
64</span>III.&nbsp; THE CITY GOVERNMENT.</h2>
<p>By the terms of the charter of 1870, the government of the City of New 
York is vested in a Mayor, Common Council, consisting of Aldermen and 
Assistant Aldermen, a Corporation Counsel, and Comptroller, all elected by 
the people.&nbsp; There are also a Department of Public Works, which has 
charge of the streets of the city, and the Croton Aqueduct and Reservoirs; 
a Department of Docks, charged with the construction of new piers, etc., 
along the harbor front; a Department of Public Parks; a Fire Department; a 
Health Department; and a Police Board.&nbsp; The heads of all these 
Departments are appointed by the Mayor of the city.&nbsp; Previous to 1870 
the city was governed by a series of commissions appointed by the Governor 
of the State, and the citizens were deprived of all voice in the management
of their own affairs.&nbsp; It was urged by the friends of the New Charter,
that that instrument restored to the citizens of New York the right of 
self-government.&nbsp; Had its provisions been honestly carried out, New 
York might have had a good government; but we shall see that they were 
perverted by a band of corrupt men into the means of the grossest 
oppression of the citizens.</p>
<p>For many years it was the habit of the respectable and educated classes 
of New York to abstain from voting.&nbsp; Many, indeed, boasted that they 
were utterly indifferent to politics; that it was immaterial to them which 
party elected its candidates.&nbsp; Others thought that they could not 
spare the time; and others still would not spare it.&nbsp; Again, there 
were those whose refined tastes made them shrink from the coarse rabble 
that surrounded the voting places.&nbsp; The reasons were almost as 
numerous as the delinquents, and the result was that the best portion of 
the voters <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
65</span>of the city&mdash;those who were most interested in a good 
government&mdash;left the control of public affairs entirely in the hands 
of the worst and most vicious classes.&nbsp; As a natural consequence, the 
suffrage being exercised chiefly by the ignorant and degraded, corrupt men 
availed themselves of the opportunity afforded them, and, by bribery and 
kindred practices, managed to secure their election to power.&nbsp; Once in
office, they exerted themselves to remain there.&nbsp; They were the rulers
of the great Metropolis of the Union, and, as such, possessed power and 
influence unequalled in any city in the world.&nbsp; They controlled the 
public funds, and thus had an opportunity of enriching themselves by 
robbing the people.&nbsp; They held in their grasp all the machinery of 
elections, and, by filling the ballot-boxes with fraudulent votes, and 
throwing out those which were legally cast, they could, they believed, 
perpetuate their power.&nbsp; If their strength in the Legislature of the 
State was inadequate to the passage of the laws they favored, they robbed 
the city treasury to buy up the members of the Legislature opposed to them,
and it was found that rural virtue was easily purchased at city 
prices.&nbsp; In this way they secured the enactment of laws tending not 
only to enlarge and perpetuate their powers, and to increase their 
opportunities for plunder, but also to bar the way of the people should 
they awake from their criminal carelessness, and seek to overthrow and 
punish them.&nbsp; It mattered very little to the men who ruled the city of
New York how the elections were decided in the rural districts.&nbsp; They 
could always swell their vote in the city to an extent sufficient to 
overcome any hostile majority in the State; and they even boasted that they
cared not how many votes were cast against them in the city, as long as 
they &ldquo;had the counting of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this way they filled 
the statute-book with laws for the oppression and injury of the people, and
in this way they passed the New Charter of 1870, which they declared was 
meant to restore self-government to New York, but which was really designed
to continue themselves in power, and break down the last obstacles between 
themselves and the city treasury.</p>
<p>In well-regulated municipal governments, the popular branch, <!-- page 
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>the Common 
Council, is designed to act, and does act, as a check upon the Executive 
branch.&nbsp; In New York, a Common Council which thoroughly represented 
the people of the city&mdash;the great commercial, social, and political 
Metropolis of the Union&mdash;would have given the Executive branch of the 
City Government no little trouble; but the respectable citizens were 
indifferent to the selection of Councilmen, and the &ldquo;Ring&rdquo; took
care that the majority of the &ldquo;City Fathers&rdquo; were creatures of 
their own, under obligations to them, and ready to sustain them in any 
outrage upon the people.</p>
<p>The Common Council of the City of New York can hardly be termed a 
representative body.&nbsp; It does not represent the honestly gotten wealth
of the city; for, though many of its members are wealthy, people look with 
suspicion upon a rich Councilman.&nbsp; It does not represent the proud 
intellectual character of New York; for there is scarcely a member who has 
intellect or education enough to enable him to utter ten sentences in good 
English.&nbsp; For many years the Councils have been composed of small 
tradesmen, who found politics more profitable than their legitimate 
callings, of bar-keepers, of men without social position in the city they 
professed to represent, and many of whom were suspected of dishonest and 
corrupt practices by their fellow-citizens.&nbsp; Indeed, it may be said, 
that, with a very few exceptions, there was not a man in this important 
body who possessed the respect or confidence of the citizens of New 
York.&nbsp; They were elected by bribery and corruption, maintained their 
positions by the same means, and enjoyed the favor and protection of the 
leaders of their party, only by aiding the execution and covering up from 
investigation the schemes of those men for their mutual engorgement at the 
expense of the public treasury.</p>
<p>Mr. James Parton gives the following account of the proceedings of this 
worshipful body:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Debates is a ludicrous word to apply to the proceedings of the 
Councilmen.&nbsp; Most of the business done by them is pushed through 
without the slightest discussion, and is of such a nature that members 
cannot be prepared to discuss it.&nbsp; The most reckless haste marks every
part of the performance.&nbsp; A member <!-- page 67--><a 
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>proposes that certain 
lots be provided with curbstones; another, that a free drinking hydrant be 
placed on a certain corner five miles up town; and another, that certain 
blocks of a distant street be paved with Belgian pavement.&nbsp; Respecting
the utility of these works, members generally know nothing, and can say 
nothing; nor are they proper objects of legislation.&nbsp; The resolutions 
are adopted, usually, without a word of explanation, and at a speed that 
must be seen to be appreciated.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;At almost every session we witnessed scenes like the following: A
member proposed to lease a certain building for a city court at $2000 a 
year for ten years.&nbsp; Honest Christopher Pullman, a faithful and 
laborious public servant, objected on one or two grounds; first, rents 
being unnaturally high, owing to several well-known and temporary causes, 
it would be unjust to the city to fix the rent at present rates for so long
a period; secondly, he had been himself to see the building, had taken 
pains to inform himself as to its value, and was prepared to prove that 
$1200 a year was a proper rent for it even at the inflated rates.&nbsp; He 
made this statement with excellent brevity, moderation, and good temper, 
and concluded by moving that the term be two instead of ten years.&nbsp; A 
robust young man, with a bull neck and of ungrammatical habits, said, in a 
tone of impatient disdain, that the landlord of the building had 
&lsquo;refused&rsquo; $1500 a year for it.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Question!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Question!&rsquo; shouted half a dozen 
angry voices; the question was instantly put, when a perfect war of 
<i>noes</i> voted down Mr. Pullman&rsquo;s amendment.&nbsp; Another hearty 
chorus of <i>ayes</i> consummated the iniquity.&nbsp; In all such affairs, 
the visitor notices a kind of ungovernable propensity to vote for spending 
money, and a prompt disgust at any obstacle raised or objection made.&nbsp;
The bull-necked Councilman of uncertain grammar evidently felt that Mr. 
Pullman&rsquo;s modest interference on behalf of the tax-payer was a most 
gross impertinence.&nbsp; He felt himself an injured being, and his 
companions shared his indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We proceed to another and better specimen: A resolution was 
introduced, appropriating $4000 for the purpose of <!-- page 68--><a 
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>presenting stands of 
colors to five regiments of city militia, which were named, each stand to 
cost eight hundred dollars.&nbsp; Mr. Pullman, as usual, objected, and we 
beg the reader to mark his objections.&nbsp; He said that he was a member 
of the committee which had reported the resolution, but he had never heard 
of it till that moment, the scheme had been &lsquo;sprung&rsquo; upon 
him.&nbsp; The chairman of the committee replied to this, that, since the 
other regiments had had colors given them by the city, he did not suppose 
that any one could object to these remaining five receiving the same 
compliment, and therefore he had not thought it worth while to summon the 
gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it is a small 
matter anyhow;&rsquo;&mdash;by which he evidently meant to intimate that 
the objector was a very small person.&nbsp; To this last remark, a member 
replied, that he did not consider $4000 so very small a matter.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Anyhow,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;we oughter save the city every 
dollar we kin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pullman resumed.&nbsp; He stated that the 
Legislature of the State, several months before, had voted a stand of 
colors to each infantry regiment in the State; that the distribution of 
these colors had already begun; that the five regiments would soon receive 
them; and that, consequently, there was no need of their having the colors 
which it was now proposed to give them.&nbsp; A member roughly replied, 
that the colors voted by the State Legislature were mere painted banners, 
&lsquo;of no account.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pullman denied this.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
am,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;captain in one of our city regiments.&nbsp; Two 
weeks ago we received our colors.&nbsp; I have seen, felt, examined, and 
marched under them; and I can testify that they are of great beauty, and 
excellent quality, made by Tiffany &amp; Co., a firm of the first standing 
in the city.&rsquo;&nbsp; He proceeded to describe the colors as being made
of the best silk, and decorated in the most elegant manner.&nbsp; He 
further objected to the price proposed to be given for the colors.&nbsp; He
declared that, from his connection with the militia, he had become 
acquainted with the value of such articles, and he could procure colors of 
the best kind ever used in the service for $375.&nbsp; The price named in 
the resolution was, therefore, most excessive.&nbsp; Upon this, another 
member rose and said, in a <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>peculiarly offensive manner, that it would be 
two years before Tiffany &amp; Co. had made all the colors, and some of the
regiments would have to wait all that time.&nbsp; &lsquo;The other 
regiments,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;have had colors presented by the city, 
and I don&rsquo;t see why we should show partiality.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon
Mr. Pullman informed the board that the <i>city</i> regiments would all be 
supplied in a few weeks; and, even if they did have to wait awhile, it was 
of no consequence, for they all had very good colors already.&nbsp; Honest 
Stephen Roberts then rose, and said that this was a subject with which he 
was not acquainted, but that if no one could refute what Mr. Pullman had 
said, he should be obliged to vote against the resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was a pause.&nbsp; The cry of &lsquo;Question!&rsquo; 
was heard.&nbsp; The ayes and noes were called.&nbsp; The resolution was 
carried by eighteen to five.&nbsp; The learned suppose that one-half of 
this stolen $4000 was expended upon the colors, and the other half divided 
among about forty persons.&nbsp; It is conjectured that each member of the 
Councilmen&rsquo;s Ring, which consists of thirteen, received about forty 
dollars for his vote on this occasion.&nbsp; This sum, added to his pay, 
which is twenty dollars per session, made a tolerable afternoon&rsquo;s 
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one witnessing this scene would certainly have supposed that 
<i>now</i> the militia regiments of the City of New York were provided with
colors.&nbsp; What was our surprise to hear, a few days after, a member 
gravely propose to appropriate $800 for the purpose of presenting the Ninth
Regiment of New York Infantry with a stand of colors.&nbsp; Mr. Pullman 
repeated his objections, and recounted anew the generosity of the State 
Legislature.&nbsp; The eighteen, without a word of reply, voted for the 
grant as before.&nbsp; It so chanced that, on our way up Broadway, an hour 
after, we met that very regiment marching down with its colors flying; and 
we observed that those colors were nearly new.&nbsp; Indeed, there is such 
a propensity in the public to present colors to popular regiments, that 
some of them have as many as five stands, of various degrees of 
splendor.&nbsp; There is nothing about which Councilmen need feel so little
anxiety as a deficiency in the supply of regimental colors.&nbsp; When, at 
last, <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>these extravagant banners voted by the corporation are presented 
to the regiments, a new scene of plunder is exhibited.&nbsp; The officers 
of the favored regiment are invited to a room in the basement of the City 
Hall, where city officials assist them to consume $300 worth of champagne, 
sandwiches, and cold chicken&mdash;paid for out of the city 
treasury&mdash;while the privates of the regiment await the return of their
officers in the unshaded portion of the adjacent park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a favorite trick with these councilmen, as of all 
politicians, to devise measures, the passage of which will gratify large 
<i>bodies</i> of voters.&nbsp; This is one of the advantages proposed to be
gained by the presentation of colors to regiments; and the same system is 
pursued with regard to churches and societies.&nbsp; At every one of the 
six sessions of the Councilmen which we attended, resolutions were 
introduced to give away the people&rsquo;s money to wealthy 
organizations.&nbsp; A church, for example, is assessed $1000 for the 
construction of a sewer, which enhances the value of the church property by
at least the amount of the assessment.&nbsp; Straightway, a member from 
that neighborhood proposes to console the stricken church with a 
&lsquo;donation&rsquo; of $1000, to enable it to pay the assessment; and as
this is a proposition to vote money, it is carried as a matter of 
course.&nbsp; We select from our notes only one of these donating 
scenes.&nbsp; A member proposed to give $2000 to a certain industrial 
school,&mdash;the favorite charity of the present time, to which all the 
benevolent most willingly subscribe.&nbsp; Vigilant Christopher Pullman 
reminded the board that it was now unlawful for the corporation to vote 
money for any object not specified in the tax levy as finally sanctioned by
the Legislature.&nbsp; He read the section of the Act which forbade 
it.&nbsp; He further showed, from a statement by the Comptroller, that 
there was no money left at their disposal for any <i>miscellaneous</i> 
objects, since the appropriation for &lsquo;city contingencies&rsquo; was 
exhausted.&nbsp; The only reply to his remarks was the instant passage of 
the resolution by eighteen to five.&nbsp; By what artifice the law is 
likely to be evaded in such cases, we may show further on.&nbsp; In all 
probability, the industrial school, in the course of the year, will receive
a fraction of <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>this money&mdash;perhaps even so large a fraction as one 
half.&nbsp; It may be that, ere now, some obliging person about the City 
Hall has offered to buy the claim for $1000, and take the risk of the 
hocus-pocus necessary for getting it&mdash;which to <i>him</i> is no risk 
at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was proposed, on another occasion, to raise the fees of the 
Inspectors of Weights and Measures&mdash;who received fifty cents for 
inspecting a pair of platform scales, and smaller sums for scales and 
measures of less importance.&nbsp; Here was a subject upon which honest 
Stephen Roberts, whose shop is in a street where scales and measures 
abound, was entirely at home.&nbsp; He showed, in his sturdy and strenuous 
manner, that, at the rates then established, an active man could make $200 
a day.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;a man can inspect, and does
inspect, fifty platform scales in an hour.&rsquo;&nbsp; The cry of 
&lsquo;Question!&rsquo; arose.&nbsp; The question was put, and the usual 
loud chorus of <i>ayes</i> followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it requires a three-fourths vote to grant money&mdash;that is,
eighteen members&mdash;it is sometimes impossible for the Ring to get that 
number together.&nbsp; There is a mode of preventing the absence, or the 
opposition of members, from defeating favorite schemes.&nbsp; It is by way 
of &lsquo;reconsideration.&rsquo;&nbsp; The time was when a measure 
distinctly voted down by a lawful majority was dead.&nbsp; But, by this 
expedient, the voting down of a measure is only equivalent to its 
postponement to a more favorable occasion.&nbsp; The moment the chairman 
pronounces a resolution lost, the member who has it in charge moves a 
reconsideration; and, as a reconsideration only requires the vote of a 
majority, <i>this</i> is invariably carried.&nbsp; By a rule of the board, 
a reconsideration carries a measure over to a future meeting&mdash;to any 
future meeting which may afford a prospect of its passage.&nbsp; The member
who is engineering it watches his chance, labors with faltering members out
of doors, and, as often as he thinks he can carry it, calls it up again, 
until at last the requisite eighteen are obtained.&nbsp; It has frequently 
happened that a member has kept a measure in a state of reconsideration for
months at a time, waiting for the happy moment to arrive.&nbsp; There was a
robust young <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
72</span>Councilman, who had a benevolent project in charge of paying $900 
for a hackney-coach and two horses, which a drunken driver drove over the 
dock into the river one cold night last winter.&nbsp; There was some 
disagreement in the Ring on this measure, and the robust youth was 
compelled to move for many reconsiderations.&nbsp; So, also, it was long 
before the wires could be all arranged to admit of the appointment of a 
&lsquo;messenger&rsquo; to the City Librarian, who has perhaps less to do 
than any man in New York who is paid $1800 a year; but perseverance meets 
its reward.&nbsp; We hear that this messenger is now smoking in the City 
Hall at a salary of $1500.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a manoeuvre also for preventing the attendance of 
obnoxious, obstructive members, like the honest six, which is ingenious and
effective.&nbsp; A &lsquo;special meeting&rsquo; is called.&nbsp; The law 
declares that notice of a special meeting must be left at the residence or 
the place of business of every member.&nbsp; Mr. Roberts&rsquo;s residence 
and Mr. Roberts&rsquo;s place of business are eight miles apart, and he 
leaves his home for the day before nine in the morning.&nbsp; If Mr. 
Roberts&rsquo;s presence at a special meeting, at 2 P.M., is desired, the 
notice is left at his shop in the morning.&nbsp; If it is not desired, the 
notice is sent to his house in Harlem, after he has left it.&nbsp; Mr. 
Pullman, cabinet-maker, leaves his shop at noon, goes home to dinner, and 
returns soon after one.&nbsp; If his presence at the special meeting, at 2 
P.M., is desired, the notice is left at his house the evening before, or at
his shop in the morning.&nbsp; If his presence is not desired, the notice 
is left at his shop a few minutes after twelve, or at his house a few 
minutes past one.&nbsp; In either case, he receives the notice too late to 
reach the City Hall in time.&nbsp; We were present in the 
Councilmen&rsquo;s Chamber when Mr. Pullman stated this inconvenience, 
assuming that it was accidental, and offered an amendment to the rule, 
requiring notice to be left five hours before the time named for the 
meeting.&nbsp; Mr. Roberts also gave his experience in the matter of 
notices, and both gentlemen spoke with perfect moderation and good 
temper.&nbsp; We wish we could convey to our readers an idea of the brutal 
insolence with which Mr. Pullman, on this occasion, was snubbed and 
defrauded by <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>a young bar-keeper who chanced to be in the chair.&nbsp; But this 
would be impossible without relating the scene at very great length.&nbsp; 
The amendment proposed was voted down, with that peculiar roar of 
<i>noes</i> which is always heard in that chamber when some honest man 
attempts to put an obstacle in the way of the free plunder of his 
fellow-citizens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These half-fledged legislators are acquainted with the device 
known by the name of the &lsquo;previous question.&rsquo;&nbsp; We 
witnessed a striking proof of this.&nbsp; One of the most audacious and 
insolent of the Ring introduced a resolution, vaguely worded, the object of
which was to annul an old paving contract, that would not pay at the 
present cost of labor and materials, and to authorize a new contract at 
higher rates.&nbsp; Before the clerk had finished reading the resolution, 
honest Stephen Roberts sprang to his feet, and, unrolling a remonstrance 
with several yards of signatures appended to it, stood, with his eye upon 
the chairman, ready to present it the moment the reading was 
concluded.&nbsp; This remonstrance, be it observed, was signed by a 
majority of the property-owners interested, the men who would be assessed 
to pay for one-half of the proposed pavement.&nbsp; Fancy the impetuous 
Roberts, with the document held aloft, the yards of signatures streaming 
down to his feet, and flowing far under his desk, awaiting the time when it
would be in order to cry out, &lsquo;Mr. President.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
reading ceased.&nbsp; Two voices were heard shouting, &lsquo;Mr. 
President.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not to Mr. Roberts that an impartial 
chairman could assign the floor.&nbsp; The member who introduced the 
resolution was the one who caught the speaker&rsquo;s eye, and that member,
forewarned of Mr. Roberts&rsquo;s intention, moved the previous 
question.&nbsp; It was in vain that Mr. Roberts shouted &lsquo;Mr. 
President;&rsquo; it was in vain that he fluttered his streaming ribbon of 
blotted paper.&nbsp; The President could not hear a word of any kind until 
a vote had been taken upon the question whether the main question should 
now be put.&nbsp; The question was carried in the affirmative by a chorus 
of <i>ayes</i>, so exactly timed that it was like the voice of one 
man.&nbsp; Then the main question <i>was</i> put, and it was carried by 
another emphatic and simultaneous shout.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>Under the rule of such a Council the public money 
disappeared.&nbsp; Men who went into the Council poor came out of it 
rich.&nbsp; Taxes increased, the cost of governing the city became greater,
crime flourished, and the chief city of the Union became noted for its 
corrupt government.</p>
<h2><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>IV.&nbsp; &ldquo;THE RING.&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE HISTORY OF THE RING.</h3>
<p>We have spoken of the outrages practised upon the citizens of New York 
by the Common Council of that city.&nbsp; We must now turn our attention to
the other branches of the City Government, and investigate the conduct of 
the real rulers of New York.</p>
<p>For several years the political power and patronage has been lodged in 
the hands of, and exercised by a set of men commonly known as &ldquo;<i>The
Ring</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They rose to power in consequence of the neglect of 
their political duties by the respectable citizens of New York, and, having
attained power, were not slow in arranging affairs so that their ill-gotten
authority might be perpetuated.&nbsp; They controlled the elections by 
bribery, and the fraudulent counting of votes, and so filled the elective 
offices with their own creatures.&nbsp; Having done this, they proceeded to
appoint to the other offices only such men as were bound to them, and whom 
they could trust to cover up their mutual dishonesty.&nbsp; Competency to 
discharge the duties of the offices thus given was not once 
considered.&nbsp; The Ring cared only for men who would unite in plundering
the public treasury, and be vigilant in averting the detection of the 
theft.&nbsp; They wanted to exercise political power, it is true, but they 
also desired to enrich themselves at the public expense.</p>
<p>Having secured the city offices, with the control of the finances, the 
police, the fire department, and the immense patronage of the city, they 
believed themselves strong enough to hold <!-- page 76--><a 
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>all they had won.&nbsp;
They did not believe that the people of New York would ever awake to a true
sense of their public duties, and, if they did, the Ring felt confident 
that they could control any election by filling the ballot-boxes with 
fraudulent votes.&nbsp; In many cases money was taken from the city 
treasury, and used to purchase votes for the Ring or Tammany Hall 
ticket.&nbsp; It was also used to bribe inspectors of elections to certify 
any returns that the leaders of the Ring might decide upon; and it came to 
be a common saying in New York that the Tammany ticket could always command
a majority in the city sufficient to neutralize any hostile vote in the 
rest of the State.&nbsp; If the leaders of the Ring desired a majority of 
25,000, 30,000, or any number, in the city, that majority was returned, and
duly sworn to by the inspectors of election, even by those of the party 
opposed to the Ring; for money was used unsparingly to buy dishonest 
inspectors.</p>
<p>As a matter of course, no honest man took part in these disgraceful 
acts, and the public offices passed, almost without exception, into the 
hands of the most corrupt portion of the population.&nbsp; They were also 
the most ignorant and brutal.&nbsp; The standard of education is, perhaps, 
lower among the public officials of New York than among any similar body in
the land.&nbsp; Men whose personal character was infamous; men who were 
charged by the newspaper press, and some of whom had been branded by courts
of justice with felonies, were elected or appointed to responsible 
offices.&nbsp; The property, rights and safety of the greatest and most 
important city in the land, were entrusted to a band of thieves and 
swindlers.&nbsp; The result was what might have been expected.&nbsp; Public
interests were neglected; the members of the Ring were too busy enriching 
themselves at the expense of the treasury to attend to the wants of the 
people.&nbsp; The City Government had never been so badly administered 
before, and the only way in which citizens could obtain their just rights 
was by paying individual members of the Ring or their satellites to attend 
to their particular cases.&nbsp; It was found almost impossible to collect 
money due by the city to private parties; but, at the same time, the Ring 
drew large <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>sums from the public treasury.&nbsp; Men who were notoriously poor
when they went into office were seen to grow suddenly and enormously 
rich.&nbsp; They made the most public displays of their suddenly acquired 
magnificence, and, in many ways, made themselves so offensive to their 
respectable neighbors, that the virtue and intelligence of the city avoided
all possible contact with them.&nbsp; Matters finally became so bad that a 
man laid himself open to grave suspicion by the mere holding of a municipal
office.&nbsp; Even the few good men who retained public positions, and whom
the Ring had not been able, or had not dared, to displace, came in for a 
share of the odium attaching to all offices connected with the City 
Government.&nbsp; It was unjust, but not unnatural.&nbsp; So many 
office-holders were corrupt that the people naturally regarded all as in 
the same category.</p>
<p>In order to secure undisturbed control of the city, the Ring took care 
to win over the Legislature of the State to their schemes.&nbsp; There was 
a definite and carefully arranged programme carried out with respect to 
this.&nbsp; The delegation from the City of New York was mainly secured by 
the Ring, and agents were sent to Albany to bribe the members of the 
Legislature to vote for the schemes of the Ring.&nbsp; Mr. Samuel J. 
Tilden, in his speech at Cooper Institute, November 2, 1871, says that 
$1,000,000, stolen from the treasury of the city, were used by the Ring to 
buy up a majority of the two Houses of the Legislature.&nbsp; By means of 
these purchased votes, the various measures of the Ring were passed.&nbsp; 
The principal measure was the Charter of the City of New York.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Under the pretence of giving back to the people of the City of New 
York local self-government, they provided that the Mayor then in office 
should appoint all the heads of Departments for a period of at least four 
years, and in some cases extending to eight, and that when those heads of 
Departments, <i>already privately agreed upon</i>, were once appointed they
should be removable only by the Mayor, who could not be impeached except on
his own motion, and then must be tried by a court of six members, every one
of whom must be present in order to form a quorum.&nbsp; And then they 
stripped every legislative power, and every executive power <!-- page 
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>from every 
other functionary of the government, and vested it in half a dozen men so 
installed for a period of from four to eight years in supreme dominion over
the people of this city.&rdquo; <a name="citation78"></a><a 
href="#footnote78" class="citation">[78]</a></p>
<p>Besides passing this infamous charter, the Ring proceeded to fortify 
their position with special legislation, designed to protect them against 
any effort of the citizens to drive them from office, or punish them.&nbsp;
This done, they had unlimited control of all the public affairs, and could 
manage the elections as they pleased, and they believed they were safe.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Committee of Seventy,&rdquo; appointed by the citizens of New
York to investigate the charges against the municipal authorities, thus 
speak of the effect of the adoption of the New Charter, in their report 
presented at the great meeting at Cooper Institute, on the 2d of November, 
1871:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not in the history of villainy a parallel for the 
gigantic crime against property conspired by the Tammany Ring.&nbsp; It was
engineered on the complete subversion of free government in the very heart 
of Republicanism.&nbsp; An American city, having a population of over a 
million, was disfranchised by an open vote of a Legislature born and 
nurtured in Democracy and Republicanism, and was handed over to a 
self-appointed oligarchy, to be robbed and plundered by them and their 
confederates, heirs and assigns for six years certainly, and prospectively 
for ever.&nbsp; A month&rsquo;s exhumation among the crimes of the Tammany 
leaders has not so familiarized us with the political paradox of the New 
Charter of the City of New York, that we do not feel that it is impossible 
that the people of this State gave to a gang of thieves, politicians by 
profession, a charter to govern the commercial metropolis of this 
continent&mdash;the great city which is to America what Paris is to 
France&mdash;to govern it with a government made unalterable for the 
sixteenth part of a century, which substantially deprived the citizens of 
self-control, nullified their right to suffrage, nullified the principle of
representation&mdash;which authorized a handful of cunning and resolute 
robbers to levy taxes, create <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>public debt, and incur municipal liabilities 
without limit and without check, and which placed at their disposal the 
revenues of the great municipality and the property of all its 
citizens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every American will say: &lsquo;It is incredible that this has 
been done.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the history of the paradox is over two years 
old.&nbsp; And it is a history of theft, robbery, and forgery, which have 
stolen and divided twenty millions of dollars; which have run up the city 
debt from $36,000,000 in 1869 to $97,000,000 in 1871, and which will be 
$120,000,000 by August, 1872; which have paid to these robbers millions of 
dollars for work never performed and materials never furnished; which paid 
astoundingly exorbitant rents to them for offices and armories, many of 
which were never occupied and some of which did not exist&mdash;which 
remitted their taxes, released their indebtedness, and remitted their 
rents, to the city due and owing&mdash;which ran the machinery for 
widening, improving and opening streets, parks and boulevards, to enable 
these men to speculate in assessed damages and greatly enhanced 
values&mdash;which created unnecessary offices with large salaries and no 
duties, in order to maintain a force of ruffianly supporters and 
manufacturers of votes&mdash;which used millions of dollars to bribe and 
corrupt newspapers, the organs of public opinion, in violation of laws 
which narrowly limited the public advertising&mdash;which camped within the
city a reserve army of voters by employing thousands of laborers at large 
pay upon nominal work, neither necessary nor useful&mdash;which bought 
legislatures and purchased judgments from courts both civil and 
criminal.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow-citizens of the City and State of New York, this report of
the doings of the Committee of Seventy would be incomplete if it did not 
fully unfold to you the perils and the difficulties of our condition.&nbsp;
You know too well that the Ring which governs us for years governed our 
Legislatures by bribing their members with moneys stolen from their 
trusts.&nbsp; That, seemingly, was supreme power and immunity.&nbsp; But it
was not enough.&nbsp; A City Charter to perpetuate power was needed.&nbsp; 
It was easily bought of a venal Legislature with the proceeds of a <!-- 
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>new scoop 
into the city treasury.&nbsp; Superadded to this the Ring had devised a 
system, faultless and absolutely sure, of counting their adversaries in an 
election out of office and of counting their own candidates in, or of 
rolling up majorities by repeating votes and voting in the names of the 
absent, the dead, and the fictitious.&nbsp; Still their intrenched camp of 
villainy was incomplete.&nbsp; It was deficient in credit.&nbsp; This is a 
ghastly jest, the self-investment of the robbers of the world with a 
boundless financial credit.&nbsp; And yet the Ring clothed themselves with 
it.&nbsp; They entrenched themselves within the imposing limits of some of 
our most powerful bank and trust companies.&nbsp; They created many savings
banks out of the forty-two which exist in the city and county of New 
York.&nbsp; This they did within the last two years.&nbsp; The published 
lists of directors will enable you to identify these institutions.&nbsp; 
Now the savings bank is a place to which money travels to be taken care of;
and if the bank has the public confidence, people put their money in it 
freely at low rates of interest, and the managers use the funds in whatever
way they please.&nbsp; In the Ring savings banks there are on deposit 
to-day, at nominal rates of interest, many millions of dollars.&nbsp; It is
believed that into these banks the Ring have taken the city&rsquo;s 
obligations and converted them into money, which has been sent flowing into
the various channels of wasteful administration, out of which they have 
drawn into their pockets millions on millions.&nbsp; The craft of this 
contrivance was profound.&nbsp; It wholly avoided the difficulty of raising
money on the unlawful and excessive issues of city and county bonds, and 
took out of public sight transactions which, if pressed upon the national 
banks, would have provoked comment and resistance, and have precipitated 
the explosion which has shaken the country.&nbsp; I think that among the 
assets of the savings banks of this city, county and State will be found 
not far from $50,000,000 of city and county debt taken for permanent 
investment.&nbsp; For the first time in the history of iniquity has the 
bank for the saving of the wages of labor been expressly organized as a 
part of a system of robbery; and for the first time in the history of 
felony have the workmen and workwomen, and the orphans and the <!-- page 
81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>children of a 
great city unwittingly cashed the obligations issued by a gang of thieves 
and plunderers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having made themselves secure, as they believed, the Ring laughed at the
idea of punishment, if detected.&nbsp; They not only controlled the 
elections, but they also controlled the administration of justice.&nbsp; 
The courts were filled with their creatures, and were so distorted from the
purposes of the law and the ends of justice, that no friend of the Ring had
any cause to fear punishment at their hands, however great his crime.&nbsp;
The majority of the crimes committed in the city were the acts of the 
adherents of the Ring, but they escaped punishment, as a rule, except when 
a sacrifice to public opinion was demanded.&nbsp; If the criminal happened 
to be a politician possessing any influence among the disreputable classes,
he was sure of acquittal.&nbsp; The magistrate before whom he was tried, 
dared not convict him, for fear of incurring either his enmity, or the 
censure of the leaders of the Ring to whom his influence was of 
value.&nbsp; So crime of all kinds increased in the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p1.jpg">
<img alt="A. OAKEY HALL, MAYOR OF NEW YORK." src="images/p1.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Under the protection of the New Charter, the Ring began a systematic 
campaign of robbery.&nbsp; Section four of the County Tax Levy, one of 
their measures, provided that liabilities against the county, the limits of
which coincide with those of the city, should be audited by the Mayor, the 
Comptroller and the President of the Board of Supervisors, or in other 
words, Mayor Hall, Comptroller Connolly, and Mr. William M. Tweed, and that
the amount found to be due should be paid.&nbsp; &ldquo;These 
Auditors,&rdquo; says Mr. Tilden, &ldquo;met but once.&nbsp; They then 
passed a resolution, which stands on the records of the city in the 
handwriting of Mayor Hall.&nbsp; It was passed on his motion, and what was 
its effect?&nbsp; It provided that all claims certified by Mr. Tweed and 
Mr. Young, Secretary of the old Board of Supervisors, should be received, 
and, on sufficient evidence, paid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the door was thrown 
open to fraud, and the crime soon followed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mayor Hall,&rdquo;
continues Mr. Tilden, &ldquo;is the responsible man for all this.&nbsp; He 
knew it was a fraudulent violation of duty on the part of every member of 
that Board of Audit to pass claims in the way they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
82</span>The door being thus thrown open to fraud, the thefts of the public
funds became numerous.&nbsp; All the appropriations authorized by law were 
quickly exhausted, and large sums of money were drawn from the treasury, 
without the slightest warrant of law.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p2.jpg">
<img alt="WILLIAM M. TWEED." src="images/p2.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The new Court House in the City Hall Park was a perfect gold mine to the
Ring.&nbsp; Immense sums were paid out of the treasury for work upon this 
building, which is still unfinished.&nbsp; Very little of this money was 
spent on the building, the greater part being retained, or stolen by the 
Ring for their own private benefit.&nbsp; The Court House has thus far cost
$12,000,000, and is unfinished.&nbsp; During the years 1869, 1870, and a 
part of 1871, the sum of about $8,223,979.89 was expended on the new Court 
House.&nbsp; During this period, the legislative appropriation for this 
purpose amounted to only $1,400,000.&nbsp; The Houses of Parliament in 
London, which cover an area of nearly eight acres, contain 100 staircases, 
1100 apartments and more than two miles of corridors, and constitute one of
the grandest architectural works of the world, cost less than 
$10,000,000.&nbsp; The Capitol of the United States at Washington, the 
largest and most magnificent building in America, will cost, when 
completed, about $12,000,000, yet, the unfinished Court House in New York 
has already cost more than the gorgeous Houses of Parliament, and as much 
as the grand Capitol of the Republic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p83.jpg">
<img alt="THE NEW COUNTY COURT HOUSE" src="images/p83.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Court House was not the only means made use of to obtain 
money.&nbsp; Heavy sums were drawn for printing, stationery, and the city 
armories, and upon other pretexts too numerous to mention.&nbsp; It would 
require a volume to illustrate and rehearse entire the robberies of the 
Ring.&nbsp; Valid claims against the city were refused payment unless the 
creditor would consent to add to his bill a sum named by, and for the use 
of, the Ring.&nbsp; Thus, a man having a claim of $1500 against the city, 
would be refused payment until he consented to make the amount $6000, or 
some such sum.&nbsp; If he consented, he received his $1500 without delay, 
and the $4500 was divided among the members of the Ring.&nbsp; When a sum 
sufficient for the <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>demands of the Ring could not be obtained by 
the connivance of actual creditors, forgery was resorted to.&nbsp; Claims 
were presented in the name of men who had no existence, who cannot now be 
found, and they were paid.&nbsp; The money thus paid went, as the recent 
investigations have shown, into the pockets of members of the Ring.&nbsp; 
Further than this, if Mr. John H. Keyser is to be believed, the Ring did 
not hesitate to forge the endorsements of living and well-known men.&nbsp; 
He says: &ldquo;The published accounts charge that I have received upwards 
of $2,000,000 from the treasury.&nbsp; Among the warrants which purport to 
have been paid to me for county work alone <i>there are upwards of eight 
hundred thousand dollars which I never received nor saw</i>, <i>and the 
endorsements on which</i>, <i>in my name</i>, <span class="smcap">are clear
and unmistakable forgeries</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another means of purloining money is thus described by Mr. Abram P. 
Genung, in a pamphlet recently issued by him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A careful examination of the books and pay-roll (of the 
Comptroller&rsquo;s Office) developed the important fact that the titles of
several accounts might be duplicated by using different phraseology to 
convey the same meaning; and that by making up pay-rolls, by using 
fictitious names of persons alleged to be temporarily employed in his (the 
Comptroller&rsquo;s) department, he could even cheat the &lsquo;heathen 
Chinee,&rsquo; who had invited him to take a hand in this little game of 
robbery.&nbsp; Hence, Mr. &lsquo;Slippery&rsquo; set about finding 
additional titles for several of the accounts, and in this way 
&lsquo;Adjusted Claims&rsquo; and &lsquo;County Liabilities&rsquo; became 
synonymous terms, and all moneys drawn on either account, instead of being 
charged to any appropriation, became a part of the permanent debt of the 
city and county.&nbsp; Under the same skilful manipulation, &lsquo;County 
Contingencies,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Contingencies in the Comptroller&rsquo;s 
Office&rsquo; meant the same thing, as did also the amount charged to 
&lsquo;Contingencies in the Department of Finance,&rsquo; generally charged
in the city accounts to make it less conspicuous.&nbsp; Again, there are 
three distinct pay-rolls in the County Bureau.&nbsp; One of these contains 
the names of all the clerks regularly employed in the Bureau, and about a 
dozen names of persons who hold sinecure positions, <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>or have no 
existence.&nbsp; The other two rolls contain about forty names, the owners 
of which, if, indeed, they have any owners, have never worked an hour in 
the department.&nbsp; The last two rolls are called &lsquo;Temporary 
Rolls,&rsquo; and the persons whose names are on them are said to be 
&lsquo;Temporary Clerks&rsquo; in the Comptroller&rsquo;s Office.&nbsp; One
of them is paid out of the regular appropriation of &lsquo;Salaries 
Executive,&rsquo; but the other is paid out of a fund raised by the sale of
&lsquo;Riot Damages Indemnity Bonds,&rsquo; and becomes a part of the 
permanent debt of the county.&nbsp; Again, there are no less than five 
different accounts to which repairs and furniture for any of the public 
offices, or the armories of the National Guard, can be charged; while more 
than half of the aggregate thus paid out, is not taken out of any 
appropriation, but is raised by the sale of revenue bonds or other 
securities, which may be converted at the pleasure of the Comptroller into 
long bonds, which will not be payable until 1911&mdash;forty years after 
many of the frauds which called them into existence shall have been 
successfully consummated by Connolly and his colleagues. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it becomes necessary to place a man in an important 
position, or a position where he must necessarily become acquainted with 
the secrets of the office, some one who is already in the confidence of the
thieves throws out a hint that their intended victim can make $100 or $200 
a month, in addition to his salary, by placing one or two fictitious names 
on one of the rolls, and drawing the checks for the salaries to which 
actual claimants would be entitled at the end of each month..&nbsp; This 
involves the necessity of signing the fictitious names on the payroll or 
voucher, when the check is received, and endorsing the same name on the 
check before the bank will cash it. . . .&nbsp; So long as he is willing to
do their bidding, and to embark in every description of rascality at their 
dictation, he can go along very smoothly; but if he should become 
troublesome at any time, or if he should show any conscientious scruples 
when called upon to execute the will of his masters, they would turn him 
adrift without an hour&rsquo;s warning, and crush him, with the evidence of
his guilt in their possession, if he had the hardihood <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>to whisper a word about
the nefarious transactions he had witnessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have not the space to enumerate the various methods of plundering the
city adopted by the Ring.&nbsp; What we have given will enable the reader 
to obtain a clear insight into their system.&nbsp; During the years 1869 
and 1870, the following sums were paid by the Comptroller:</p>

<p>These are the figures given by the &ldquo;Joint Committee of Supervisors
and Aldermen appointed to investigate the public accounts of the City and 
County of New York.&rdquo; <a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86" 
class="citation">[86]</a>&nbsp; In their report, presented about the 9th of
October, 1871, they say: &ldquo;Your Committee find that immense sums have 
been paid for services which have not been performed, for materials which 
have not been furnished, and to employ&eacute;s who are unknown in the 
offices from which they draw their salaries.&nbsp; Also, that parties 
having just claims upon the city, failing to obtain payment therefor, have 
assigned their claims to persons officially or otherwise connected with 
different departments, who have in <!-- page 87--><a 
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>many instances 
fraudulently increased their amounts, and drawn fourfold the money actually
due from the city.&nbsp; Thus it appears in the accounts that hundreds of 
thousands of dollars have been paid to private parties who positively deny 
the receipt of the money, or any knowledge whatever of the false bills 
representing the large sums paid to them.&nbsp; These investigations compel
the belief that not only the most reckless extravagance, but frauds and 
peculations of the grossest character have been practised in several of the
departments, and that these must have been committed in many instances with
the knowledge and cooperation of those appointed, and whose sworn duty it 
was to guard and protect the public interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the management of the Ring, the cost of governing the city was 
about thirty millions of dollars annually.&nbsp; The city and county debt 
(practically the same, since both are paid by the citizens of New York,) 
was doubled every two years.&nbsp; On the 1st of January, 1869, it was 
$36,000,000.&nbsp; By January 1st, 1871, it had increased to 
$73,000,000.&nbsp; On the 14th of September, 1871, it was $97,287,525, and 
the Citizens&rsquo; Committee declare that there is grave reason to believe
that it will reach $120,000,000 during the present year (1871).</p>
<p>For several years the Ring continued their robberies of the treasury, 
enriching themselves and bringing the city nearer to bankruptcy every 
year.&nbsp; Taxes increased, property was assessed for improvements that 
were never made, and the assessments were rigorously collected.&nbsp; Large
sums were paid for cleaning the streets, which streets were kept clean only
by the private subscriptions of the citizens residing in them, as the 
writer can testify from his personal experience.&nbsp; The burdens of the 
people became heavier and heavier, and the members of the Ring grew richer 
and richer.&nbsp; They built them palatial residences in the city, and 
their magnificent equipages were the talk of the town.&nbsp; They gave 
sumptuous entertainments, they flaunted their diamonds and jewels in the 
eyes of a dumbfounded public, they made ostentatious gifts to the poor, and
munificent subscriptions to cathedrals and churches, <i>all with money 
stolen from the city</i>; and with this same money they endeavored to 
control the <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>operations of Wall street, the great financial centre of the 
Republic.&nbsp; They built them country seats, the beauty and magnificence 
of which were duly set forth in the illustrated journals of the day; and 
they surrounded themselves with every luxury they could desire&mdash;all 
with money stolen from the city.&nbsp; Did any man dare to denounce their 
robberies, they turned upon him with one accord, and the whole power of the
Ring was used to crush their daring assailant.&nbsp; They encouraged their 
adherents to levy blackmail upon the citizens of New York, and it came to 
be well understood in the great city that no man, however innocent, 
arrested on a civil process, could hope to regain the liberty which was his
birthright, without paying the iniquitous toll levied upon him by some 
portion of the Ring.&nbsp; Even the great writ of Habeas Corpus&mdash;the 
very bulwark of our liberties&mdash;was repeatedly set at defiance by the 
underlings of the Ring, for the purpose of extorting money from some 
innocent man who had fallen into their clutches.</p>
<p>The Ring was all-powerful in the great city, and they there built up an 
organized despotism, the most infamous known to history.&nbsp; No 
man&rsquo;s rights, no man&rsquo;s liberties were safe, if he ventured to 
oppose them.&nbsp; They even sought to strike down freedom of speech and 
the liberty of the press.&nbsp; Mr. Samuel J. Tilden, in the speech from 
which we have quoted before in this chapter, makes this distinct charge 
against them.&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;Mr. Evarts went to Albany last year, 
and carried with him my protest against the passage of the law giving to 
the judges a power unknown in the jurisprudence of this State&mdash;unknown
in the jurisprudence of the United States for the last thirty 
years&mdash;<i>whereby it was secured that any member of the City 
Government that might be offended</i>, <i>could put his hand upon the city 
press</i>, <i>and suppress its liberties and freedom of 
speech</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long all this would have continued, it is impossible to say, had it 
not pleased God that there should be jealousies and dissensions amongst the
members of the Ring strong enough to break even the infamous bonds that had
so long bound them together.</p>
<p>The citizens of New York had for some time been slowly <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>coming to the 
conclusion that they were losing their rights and property, and had been 
seeking for some legal means of attacking and overthrowing the Ring.&nbsp; 
Their great necessity was absolute and definite proof of fraud on the part 
of certain individuals.&nbsp; This was for a long time lacking, but it came
at length.&nbsp; In July, 1871, a former prominent member of the Ring, 
having quarrelled with the Ring over a claim of three or four hundred 
thousand dollars, which Mr. Tweed had refused to allow, avenged himself by 
causing the publication of a series of the public accounts, transcribed 
from the books of the Comptroller.&nbsp; These accounts showed the millions
that had been fraudulently paid away for work which had never been done, 
and furnished the first definite evidence of fraud on the part of the 
members of the Ring that had been given to the public.&nbsp; The press, 
with the exception of a few unimportant sheets owned or controlled by the 
Ring, denounced the frauds, and demanded an investigation of the public 
accounts.&nbsp; Mayor Hall, William M. Tweed, Richard B. Connolly, and all 
the greater and lesser magnates of the Ring were implicated in the terrible
story told by the published accounts.&nbsp; The respectable citizens, 
without regard to party, at once joined in the demand, and expressed their 
determination to put an end to the power of the Ring.&nbsp; The whole 
land&mdash;nay the whole civilized world&mdash;rang with a universal cry of
indignation.&nbsp; The temper of the citizens was such as admitted of no 
trifling.</p>
<p>The publication of the Comptroller&rsquo;s accounts, which revealed the 
stupendous system of fraud they had practised so successfully, burst upon 
the Ring like a clap of thunder from a clear sky.&nbsp; It not only 
surprised them, but it demoralized them.&nbsp; They were fairly 
stunned.&nbsp; At first they affected to treat the whole matter as a 
partisan outburst which would soon &ldquo;blow over.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of 
the more timid took counsel of their fears and fled from the city, some 
even quitting the country.&nbsp; The more hardened endeavored &ldquo;to 
brave it out,&rdquo; and defiantly declared that the citizens could not 
molest them.&nbsp; All the while the wrath of the people grew hotter, and 
the demand for the publication of the Comptroller&rsquo;s accounts became 
more urgent.&nbsp; Comptroller <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Connolly, conscious of his guilt, met this 
demand with vague promises of compliance.&nbsp; Mayor Hall set himself to 
work to prove that the whole affair was a mistake, that no money had been 
stolen, that the City Government had been unjustly assailed, and by his 
ill-advised efforts drew upon himself a larger share of the public 
indignation and suspicion than had previously been accorded to him.&nbsp; 
The great object of the Ring was to gain time.&nbsp; They meant that the 
Comptroller&rsquo;s accounts should not be published, and to accomplish 
this they began the attempt to get possession of the Comptroller&rsquo;s 
office, the records of which contained the evidence of their crimes.&nbsp; 
With this important department in their hands they could suppress this 
evidence, or, if driven to desperation, destroy it.&nbsp; A council of the 
leaders of the Ring was called, at which it was resolved to get Mr. 
Connolly out of the Comptroller&rsquo;s office, and to put in his place a 
creature of their own.&nbsp; They did not dare, however, to make an effort 
to oust Connolly, without having some plausible pretext for their 
action.&nbsp; They feared that he would expose their mutual villainy, and 
involve them in his ruin, and they wished to prevent this.&nbsp; Still, 
they resolved to get rid of him, and their plan was first to crush him, and
thus prevent his exposing them.&nbsp; We shall see how their plan 
worked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the public indignation had been growing stronger daily.&nbsp; 
On the 4th of September, 1871, a large and harmonious meeting of citizens, 
without regard to party, was held at Cooper Institute.&nbsp; At this 
meeting it was resolved to compel an exposure of the frauds practised upon 
the people, and to punish the guilty parties; and committees were 
appointed, money subscribed, and the best legal talent in the city retained
for that purpose.&nbsp; A reform movement to carry the November elections 
in the interest of the citizens and tax-payers was inaugurated, and the 
power of the courts was invoked to put a stop to the further expenditure of
the city funds.&nbsp; The popular sentiment was too strong to be mistaken, 
and some of the leading officials, and several journals which had 
previously supported the Ring, took the alarm and entered the ranks of the 
party of Reform.&nbsp; The Democratic party of the State repudiated the 
Ring, and it was <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>plain that the Tammany ticket would be 
supported only by the lowest classes of the city voters.&nbsp; The members 
of the Ring were now thoroughly aroused to the danger which threatened 
them; but, true to their corrupt instincts, they endeavored to meet it by 
fraud.&nbsp; They appointed a Committee of Aldermen to act with the 
Citizens&rsquo; Committee in the investigation of the alleged frauds, and 
then withheld from them all evidence that could be of service to them.</p>
<p>The Comptroller&rsquo;s office contained not only the accounts of moneys
paid out, but also the vouchers for all sums expended, properly signed and 
sworn to by the parties receiving the money, and these vouchers constituted
the principal proof of the frauds.&nbsp; On Monday, September 11th, the 
city was startled by the announcement that the office of the Comptroller 
had been forcibly entered during the previous day, Sunday, and that the 
vouchers covering the principal transactions of the Ring had been 
stolen.&nbsp; It was a bold deed, and was so thoroughly characteristic of 
the Ring, that the public at once attributed it to that body.&nbsp; The 
Ring on their part endeavored to produce the belief that the Comptroller 
had stolen the vouchers to screen himself.&nbsp; Mayor Hall immediately 
wrote a peremptory letter to Mr. Connolly, asking him to resign his 
position as he (the Comptroller) had lost the confidence of the 
people.&nbsp; Mr. Connolly was not slow to perceive that the Ring were 
determined to sacrifice him to secure their own safety, and he declined to 
become their victim.&nbsp; He not only refused to resign his position at 
Mayor Hall&rsquo;s demand, but set to work vigorously to discover and bring
to light the persons who had stolen the vouchers.&nbsp; To have stolen the 
vouchers himself, or to have countenanced the robbery, would have been 
worse than folly on the part of the Comptroller.&nbsp; It would have 
damaged him fatally with the citizens, who were disposed to deal lightly 
with him if he would aid them in getting at and punishing the villainies of
his former confederates.&nbsp; There was no reason why he should seek to 
screen the Ring, for they made no secret of their intention to destroy 
him.&nbsp; In view, therefore, of the facts as at present known, it seems 
certain that the theft was brought about by the <!-- page 92--><a 
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Ring for the purpose of
throwing the suspicion of the crime upon the Comptroller, and thus giving 
them a pretext for crushing him.</p>
<p>Wisely for himself, Mr. Connolly determined to let the Ring shift for 
themselves, and throw himself upon the mercy of the Reform party.&nbsp; He 
withdrew from the active discharge of the duties of his office, and 
appointed Mr. Andrew H. Green&mdash;an eminent citizen, possessing the 
respect and confidence of all parties&mdash;his deputy, with full powers, 
and avowed his determination to do his utmost to afford the Citizens&rsquo;
Committee a full and impartial investigation of his affairs.&nbsp; The Ring
made great efforts to prevent his withdrawal, or, rather, the appointment 
of Mr. Green.&nbsp; Says Mr. Samuel J. Tilden, who was the real cause of 
this action on Mr. Connolly&rsquo;s part, and who was the acknowledged 
leader of the Reform Democracy during the contest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Mr. Connolly came to my house on that morning on which he 
executed an abdication in favor of Mr. Green, he was accompanied by two 
counsel, one of whom was half an hour behind time, and I learned, not from 
him, but from other sources, that he spent that half hour at the house of 
Peter B. Sweeny.&nbsp; When the conference went on, he said, not speaking 
for himself individually, but still he would state the views taken by other
friends of Mr. Connolly as to what he should do.&nbsp; He said he was 
assured that some respectable man would be put in the office of 
Comptroller, and that then he would say to Mr. Booth, of the Common Council
Committee, and to the Committee of Seventy: &lsquo;I am competent to make 
every necessary investigation myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; And that then everything
that would hurt the party would be kept back; and that was the 
consideration presented to Mr. Connolly in my presence, and in the presence
of Mr. Havemeyer and the two counsel.&nbsp; I told Mr. Connolly that the 
proposition was wrong, and would fail, and ought to fail; that no man had 
character enough to shut off the injured and indignant citizens from the 
investigation desired; and if he attempted to do it, it would ruin 
everybody concerned in it, and plunge him in a deeper ruin.&nbsp; That his 
only chance and <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>hope was in doing right from that day, and 
throwing himself upon the charity and humanity of those who had been 
wronged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Failing to prevent the appointment of Mr. Green, the Ring endeavored to 
ignore it.&nbsp; The Mayor professed to regard the Comptroller&rsquo;s 
withdrawal from his office as a resignation of his post.&nbsp; He at once 
announced his acceptance of this resignation, and proceeded to appoint a 
successor to Mr. Connolly.&nbsp; Here, however, the Ring met with another 
defeat.&nbsp; During the early part of 1871, Mr. Connolly had some idea of 
visiting Europe, and, in order to keep prying eyes from his official 
records, had procured the passage of a law by the Legislature, authorizing 
him to appoint a Deputy-Comptroller, who &ldquo;shall, in addition to his 
other powers, possess every power, and perform every duty belonging to the 
office of Comptroller, whenever the said Comptroller shall, by due written 
authority, and during a period to be specified in such authority, designate
and authorize the said Deputy-Comptroller to possess the power and perform 
the duty aforesaid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Connolly thus had the legal power to 
appoint Mr. Green, and the Mayor&rsquo;s refusal to recognize the 
appointment was mere bombast.&nbsp; The best legal talent in New York 
sustained Mr. Connolly, and the Mayor&rsquo;s own law officer advised him 
that he must respect the appointment; and so the statute that had been 
framed for the protection of the Ring was unexpectedly used for their 
destruction.</p>

<img alt="THE ROBBERY OF THE VOUCHERS" src="images/p94.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Still another discomfiture awaited the Ring.&nbsp; A few days after the 
appointment of Mr. Green, a servant girl employed in the family of the 
janitor of the new Court House, unexpectedly revealed, under oath, the 
manner in which the vouchers were stolen from the Comptroller&rsquo;s 
office, and the names of the thieves.&nbsp; Her sworn statement is as 
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>City and County of New York</i>, <i>ss</i>.&mdash;Mary Conway,
being duly sworn, doth depose and say: I have lived with Mr. and Mrs. 
Haggerty, in the County Court-House, for over fourteen months, as cook; for
about three or four months I did general housework; on Sunday morning, 
September 10th, I got out of bed with the child that slept with me, wanting
to get up; I <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>don&rsquo;t know whether it was half-past six or seven 
o&rsquo;clock; Mrs. Haggerty came into the room in her night-dress; and 
said to me, &lsquo;it is too early to get up yet;&rsquo; I said to her, 
&lsquo;being as I am up I guess I will dress myself;&rsquo; as I was 
dressed I went out into the hall; I heard a knocking down stairs; I said to
Mrs. Haggerty, &lsquo;it sounds as if it was at the Comptroller&rsquo;s 
door;&rsquo; I went over to the kitchen, unlocked the kitchen door, and 
went down stairs to the head of the stairs that leads to the 
Comptroller&rsquo;s hall; I saw Charley Baulch knocking at the 
Comptroller&rsquo;s door, and calling, &lsquo;Murphy, are you 
there?&rsquo;&nbsp; Murphy is a watchman; I came up stairs and went back to
the kitchen; shortly after I went down stairs again and saw Charley Baulch 
with the door of the Comptroller&rsquo;s office open, he holding it back on
the outside, and I saw Mr. Haggerty come out of the door with bundles of 
papers in his arms and bring them up to his bedroom; the door where he came
out is at the foot of the stairs, where the glass is broken, going into the
County Bureau; I came back, and did not go down any more; each bundle of 
papers was tied with either a pink tape or a pink ribbon round them; the 
next thing, I went over from the kitchen out into the hall for a scuttle of
coal; in this hall Mr. Haggerty&rsquo;s bedroom door faced me; I saw a man 
with gray clothes going in there with another bundle of papers like what 
Mr. Haggerty had; then I brought back the coal to the kitchen, and put it 
on the fire; the next I saw was this man with the gray clothes going down 
with a pillow-case on his back, full, that looked as though filled with 
papers, shaped like the bundles Mr. Haggerty had; at the same time he went 
down the stairs Charley Baulch said to him, &lsquo;This way;&rsquo; I kind 
of judged there was something up, and I went to look in the drawer where 
the pillow-cases were, and I missed one of the linen pillow-cases; I did 
this soon afterward; soon after the man went down with the pillow-case, 
Mrs. Haggerty came into the kitchen, giving me a key, and telling me to go 
over to the drying-room; that is a room separate from the bedrooms; there 
was a chest there full of linen, table linen and bed linen, and silver 
right down in the bottom; she told me to get a nut-picker and bring it <!--
page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>over, as 
Mr. Haggerty wanted one; I took all the clothes out of the trunk, and got 
the nut-picker and brought it back to her, and before I got into the 
kitchen I said to Mrs. Haggerty, &lsquo;What is the matter?&nbsp; The 
kitchen&rsquo;s all black with smoke, and the dining room&rsquo;s all black
with smoke.&rsquo;&nbsp; She said, &lsquo;Mr. Haggerty wanted these papers 
burned, I told him not to put them in, but he wants them burned;&rsquo; I 
went over to the range to cook some eggs for breakfast; it was full of 
burned papers on the top and in the bottom; there lay a bundle of papers on
the top that were about half burned, with a piece of pink tape around them;
I put on the cover again; they were partly smothered, going out; Mrs. 
Haggerty had a poker stirring up the papers on the top and underneath, 
where the ashes were; the bottom of the range was full of burning papers, 
and Mrs. Haggerty had the poker stirring them up so that they would burn 
faster; from underneath the range and the top she took three or four 
pailfuls of burned papers and emptied them up stairs on the attic floor, in
a heap of ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday next, when Mrs. Haggerty came home from the market, 
she asked me if there was anything new about this robbery in the 
Comptroller&rsquo;s office; I told her I did not know; I didn&rsquo;t hear 
nothing, no more than a man came up stairs to-day, and asked me if I let 
anybody in on Sunday, or if I knew anybody to come into the building on 
Sunday; I told him I did not know who came in; I didn&rsquo;t attend to the
front door; I was cooking, and had nothing to do with the front door; and I
asked the man who sent him up stairs; and he said a man down in the hall 
sent him up stairs to inquire; next, I told Mrs. Haggerty that if I had 
known it was Charley Baulch sent him up stairs to find any information from
me, I should have told the man to go down stairs, that Charley Baulch knew 
as much about it as I did, and more, for he was one of the men that helped 
to rob it; she said to me, &lsquo;Christ!&nbsp; If Charley Baulch knowed 
that, he&rsquo;d run into the East River and drown himself&mdash;if he 
knowed you saw him;&rsquo; this was on Tuesday night I told her this; Mr. 
Haggerty left town on Tuesday, saying he was going to Saratoga with Hank 
Smith, and he <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
97</span>would be home on Thursday or Friday, and on Wednesday night he got
home from Saratoga; Mrs. Haggerty told him the remarks that I made to her 
on Tuesday night about the robbery; that I saw all that passed; she told me
on Thursday morning that she told Mr. Haggerty about it all, last night; 
that he was going to wash his feet, but he felt so bad over it; they sat up
for two hours in the room talking, and he didn&rsquo;t wash his feet; on 
Thursday morning when Mr. Haggerty came into the kitchen, he came to me, 
running in, and said, &lsquo;Mary!&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, 
&lsquo;Sir!&rsquo;&nbsp; Said he, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to speak of
what you saw passed here on Sunday morning; I don&rsquo;t want you to tell 
these old women or old men in the building; Charley Baulch done it for me, 
and I done it for another man;&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t told 
it to anyone;&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;You did tell it to Kitty&rsquo; (his 
wife); I said, &lsquo;She knew as much about it as I did; she saw the 
papers burning;&rsquo; on next Friday of that same week I saw Mark 
Haggerty, Mr. Haggerty&rsquo;s brother, who is a detective in the 
Mayor&rsquo;s office, I think; I called him up stairs and asked him to come
in; he said, &lsquo;No, I am afraid to come in; I am afraid of Ed.,&rsquo; 
that is, Mr. Haggerty; they have not been on speaking terms in a year; I 
then told him the occurrences that happened in the Court-House on Sunday 
morning; I told him I didn&rsquo;t feel like staying there; that I was 
almost crazy about it; he told me to keep it still; that if anybody would 
hear about it outside they would be collared; I asked him would it be 
prison; he said certainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Saturday night I went down to the market where Mrs. Haggerty 
keeps a stand, and told her that I was going to leave for a few days until 
this mess would be settled, for fear there would be any arrest, and I 
should be a witness; she told me all I had to say was that I knew nothing 
about it; I told her a false oath I would not give; what I saw with my eyes
I would swear to; she told me I could do as I chose about it; that I might 
go against Mr. Haggerty if I chose; she said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s foolish of 
you to think so; you ought to go to headquarters and consult Mr. Kelso 
about it;&rsquo; I told her no, it was none of my business to go and 
consult him about Mr. Haggerty&rsquo;s robbery; <!-- page 98--><a 
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>then she and I came 
together to the Court-House; I got a couple of dresses and a night dress; I
went down stairs; she went with me; I met a policeman at the door, and he 
asked me where I was going; I told him I was going to see my uncle&rsquo;s 
wife; she was sick; I then went down to Washington street; I came up for my
clothes yesterday (Tuesday); the rooms were locked; I went down to the 
market to where Mrs. Haggerty does business, and the first thing she said 
to me was, &lsquo;By Christ Almighty, Mr. Haggerty will take your 
life!&rsquo;&nbsp; I says to her, &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; she said, 
&lsquo;What you told Mark;&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told him the 
truth about the robbery;&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;Your life will be taken, 
by Christ Almighty!&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;I want my clothes;&rsquo; 
She said, &lsquo;You can get your clothes any time, what belongs to 
you;&rsquo; she did not come up, and did not open the door; I left my trunk
in the hall of the Court-House, that I brought to put my clothes in; they 
are over there yet; on that day, before I saw Mrs. Haggerty, Mr. Murphy 
came to me and asked me if I knowed anything about the robbery; if I did, 
please to tell the Comptroller; I kind of smiled, and said I knew nothing 
about it; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I know you know something 
about it;&rsquo; I was making the bed in Mr. Haggerty&rsquo;s room when Mr.
Murphy came up and asked me if I knew anything about it; I kind of smiled, 
and said &lsquo;No;&rsquo; Mr. Murphy says, &lsquo;I know better, you 
do;&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;Suppose you should be
arrested, then you&rsquo;d have to prove about it whether you knew anything
about it or not;&rsquo; that was in the hall; said I, &lsquo;When I&rsquo;m
arrested, it&rsquo;s time enough to prove it then;&rsquo; I then promised 
to see him on the stoop on Saturday night, but I did not; I came up on 
Sunday morning, and left word at the Hook and Ladder House to have Mr. 
Murphy come and see me on Sunday night at No. 95 Washington street; Murphy 
came to me, and I told him I would go up to the Comptroller&rsquo;s house 
with him and tell the Comptroller all I knew about it, and that I was not 
doing it for any reward or money; I was doing it to clear the Comptroller 
in the eyes of the people; I went on Tuesday morning with Murphy to the 
Comptroller&rsquo;s house, and made the above statement; this <!-- page 
99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>morning there 
was a policeman came into the house where I was staying at No. 95 
Washington street; the woman in the house told me he would give me advice 
about the clothes I had left in the Court-House; he asked me if I had any 
charge against Haggerty; I told him no, no more than what happened there 
and what I saw on Sunday morning week, and I explained it to him; he asked 
me, &lsquo;Have you been speaking to Mr. Connolly?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, 
&lsquo;Yes, certainly;&rsquo; the policeman went out of the house; the 
captain (as the woman called him) came to the door and knocked, and asked 
the woman about me; she said I had stepped out; he brought her out on the 
sidewalk, and was talking to her a little while, and as I was in the room I
heard him speak Hank Smith&rsquo;s name to her once; when she came in she 
said he told her that he would like to see me and have a talk with me, 
because they would do as much for me as Mr. Connolly would in this 
business.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mary Conway</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sworn to before me, Sept. 20th, 1871.</p>

&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thos. A. Ledwith</span>, Police 
Justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In consequence of this disclosure, Baulch and Haggerty were arrested on 
the charge of stealing the vouchers.&nbsp; Search was made in the 
Court-House, and the half-charred fragments of the vouchers were found in a
room used for the storage of old lumber.&nbsp; Naturally, the Ring 
endeavored to treat this discovery as a trick of the Comptroller&rsquo;s, 
and they furnished the men charged with the theft with able counsel to 
defend them.</p>
<p>The citizens on their part endeavored to bring matters to a satisfactory
termination and secure the punishment of the Ring; but the members of that 
body met them at every step with defiance and effrontery.&nbsp; They used 
every means in their power to prevent an investigation of the public 
accounts, and to defeat the efforts that were made to recover the money 
they had stolen from the city.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Citizens&rsquo; 
Committee labored faithfully, and, through the efforts of Mr. Tilden, 
evidence was obtained sufficient to cause the arrest of Mr. Tweed.&nbsp; 
Garvey, Woodward, and Ingersoll sought safety in flight.&nbsp; Mayor Hall 
was arrested on the charge of sharing the plunder obtained by the Ring, but
the examining magistrate declined to hold him on <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>the charge for lack 
of evidence against him, and the Grand Jury refused to indict him, for the 
same reason.&nbsp; Mr. Tweed had been nominated for the State Senate by a 
constituency composed of the most worthless part of the population, and, in
spite of the charges against him, he continued to present himself for the 
suffrages of these people, by whom he was elected at the November 
election.&nbsp; In due time the various committees appointed by the 
citizens made their reports, presenting the facts we have embodied in this 
chapter.&nbsp; The guilt of the members of the Ring was proven so clearly 
that no reasonable person could doubt it; but still grave fears were 
expressed that it would be impossible to bring these men to justice, in 
consequence of the arts of shrewd counsel and legal quibbles.&nbsp; The 
determination of the citizens grew with the approach of the 
elections.&nbsp; Their last great victory over the Ring was achieved at the
polls on the 7th of November, when the entire Ring ticket in the city, with
but one or two exceptions, was overwhelmingly defeated.</p>
<p>Whether the guilty parties will be punished as they deserve, or whether 
the citizens will allow the prosecutions they have instituted to flag, the 
future alone can decide.&nbsp; At the present there is reason to fear that 
the guilty will escape.&nbsp; Should this fear be realized, the citizens of
New York will have abundant cause to regret it.&nbsp; The Ring is badly 
beaten, but it is not destroyed.&nbsp; Many of its members are still in 
office, and there are still numbers of its followers ready to do its 
bidding.&nbsp; Until the last man tainted with the infamy of an alliance 
with the Ring is removed from office, the people of New York may be sure 
that the danger is not at an end.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; PERSONNEL OF THE RING.</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, the Ring may be said to include every office-holder 
in the city, and it is very certain that of late every official has come in
for a share of the suspicion with which the <!-- page 101--><a 
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>people regard the 
transactions of the Ring.&nbsp; It would be impossible to give an accurate 
and complete list of the members of that body, for many of them are not yet
known to the public; but the recent investigations have shown that it is 
not composed exclusively of Democrats.&nbsp; A number of Republicans, while
openly acting with their party, have been found to be allied with and in 
the pay of the Ring.</p>
<p>The men who are supposed to have played the most conspicuous parts in 
the doings of the Ring, and who are believed by the public to be chiefly 
responsible for its acts, are Mayor A. O. Hall, Richard B. Connolly, 
William M. Tweed, Peter B. Sweeny, J. H. Ingersoll, Andrew J. Garvey, and 
E. A. Woodward.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">A. Oakey Hall</span>, Mayor of the city, was born in
New York, is of American parentage, and is about forty-six years old.&nbsp;
He received a good education, and at an early age began the study of the 
law.&nbsp; He removed to New Orleans soon after, and was for a while in the
office of the Hon. John Slidell.&nbsp; He subsequently returned to New 
York, where he became associated with the late Mr. Nathaniel Blunt, as 
Assistant District-Attorney.&nbsp; Upon the death of Mr. Blunt, he was 
elected District-Attorney by the Whig party, and held that position for 
about twelve years.&nbsp; At the end of that time, he was elected Mayor of 
New York, to succeed John T. Hoffman, now Governor of the State.&nbsp; For 
some years he has been a member of the law firm of Brown, Hall &amp; 
Vanderpoel, which firm enjoys a large and lucrative practice.&nbsp; He is 
said to be a lawyer of considerable ability, and has undoubtedly had great 
experience in criminal practice.&nbsp; As a politician, his experience has 
also been extensive and varied.&nbsp; He began life as a Whig, but became a
prominent Know-Nothing in the palmy days of that party.&nbsp; Finding 
Know-Nothingism a failure, however, he became a Republican, from which 
party, about nine or ten years ago, he passed over to the Democrats.</p>
<p>A writer in <i>Every Saturday</i> thus speaks of him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Honor has some facility as a writer, and for twenty years has
maintained a quasi or direct connection with the <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>press.&nbsp; He is 
not lacking in the culture of desultory reading, and when he chooses to do 
so can bear himself like a gentleman.&nbsp; Of such a thing as dignity of 
character, he appears to have but a faint conception.&nbsp; Pedantry is 
more to him than profundity, and to tickle the ear of the town with a cheap
witticism, he deems a greater thing than to command it with a forcible 
presentation of grave issues.&nbsp; The essential type of the man was 
presented to public gaze about two years ago, when he stood on the City 
Hall steps dressed from head to foot in a suit of green to review a St. 
Patrick&rsquo;s procession.&nbsp; He is a harlequin with the literary 
ambition of a Richelieu.&nbsp; He affects an intimacy with the stage, and 
has done something in the way of producing plays.&nbsp; He can write 
clearly and concisely when he will, but prefers to provoke with odd quips 
and far-fetched conceits.&nbsp; He patronizes journalists and magazine 
writers with a sort of grotesque familiarity, and readily makes himself at 
home among the Bohemians of Literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since his union with the Democracy, Mr. Hall has been the constant and 
intimate associate of the men who have brought disgrace and loss upon the 
city, and of late years he has been regarded as one of the leading members 
of the Ring.&nbsp; It is said openly in New York that he owes his election 
to the Mayoralty entirely to William M. Tweed.&nbsp; As Mayor of the city, 
he has been officially connected with many of the transactions by which the
city has been defrauded of large sums of money.&nbsp; Some of the most 
prominent newspapers of the city have denounced him as a thief and a sharer
of the stolen money.&nbsp; His friends, on the other hand, have declared 
their belief that his worst fault was his official approval of the 
fraudulent warrants.&nbsp; They state that he has never in his manner of 
living, or in any other way, given evidence of possessing large sums of 
money, and his legal partner made oath before the Grand Jury that Mr. Hall 
was not worth over $60,000 or $70,000.&nbsp; It is certain that when the 
proprietor of the <i>New York Times</i>, which journal had been loud in 
denouncing Hall as a thief, was called on by the Grand Jury to furnish them
with the evidence upon which this charge was based, he was unable to do so,
and the Grand Jury was <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>unable to obtain any evidence criminating Mr. 
Hall personally.&nbsp; His friends declare that his signing the fraudulent 
warrants was a purely ministerial act, and that having many thousands of 
them to sign in a year, he was compelled to rely upon the endorsements of 
the Comptroller and auditing officers.</p>
<p>In the present state of affairs, there is no evidence showing that Mr. 
Hall derived any personal pecuniary benefit from the frauds upon the 
treasury.&nbsp; Public sentiment is divided respecting him; many persons 
believing that he is a sharer in the plunder of the Ring, and others 
holding the opposite opinion.&nbsp; The most serious charges that have been
made against him, have been brought by Mr. John Foley, and Mr. Samuel J. 
Tilden.&nbsp; The former is the President of the Nineteenth Ward 
Citizens&rsquo; Association, and the latter the leader of the Reform 
Democracy.&nbsp; Mr. Tilden, in his speech at the Cooper Institute, 
November 2d, 1871, thus spoke of Mayor Hall:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These three Auditors met but once.&nbsp; They then passed a 
resolution which now stands on the records of the city in the handwriting 
of Mayor Hall.&nbsp; It was passed on his motion, and what was its 
effect?&nbsp; Did it audit anything?&nbsp; Did it perform the 
functions?&nbsp; Did it fulfil the trust committed to the Board?&nbsp; Not 
a bit of it.&nbsp; It provided that all claims certified by Mr. Tweed and 
Mr. Young, Secretary of the old Board of Supervisors, should be received, 
and, on sufficient evidence, paid.&nbsp; Mayor Hall is the responsible man 
for all this.&nbsp; He knew it was a fraudulent violation of duty on the 
part of every member of that Board of Audit to pass claims in the way they 
did.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow-citizens, let me call your attention for a moment to the 
after-piece of these transactions.&nbsp; Our friend, Mayor Hall, is a very 
distinguished dramatist, and he would consider it a very serious offence to
the drama to have the after-piece left out.&nbsp; Now, what was that 
after-piece?&nbsp; When the statements were published in regard to these 
frauds, Mayor Hall published a card, wherein he said that these accounts 
were audited by the old Board of Supervisors, and that neither he nor Mr. 
Connolly was at all responsible for them.&nbsp; A little later&mdash;about 
August <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
104</span>16th&mdash;Mayor Hall said it was true they were audited by the 
Board of Audit, and, in doing so, they performed a ministerial function, 
and would have been compelled by mandamus to do it, if they hadn&rsquo;t 
done it willingly.&nbsp; I do not deem it necessary in the presence of an 
intelligent audience and the lawyers sitting around me on this stage, to 
present any observations upon the idea that &lsquo;to audit and to pay the 
amount found due&rsquo; was a ministerial function. . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we pass to Mr. Hall&rsquo;s fourth defence.&nbsp; On the 
burning of the vouchers he made a raid on Mr. Connolly.&nbsp; He wrote him 
a public letter, demanding his resignation in the name of the public 
because he had lost the public confidence; and at the same time he was 
writing to Mr. Tweed touching and tender epistles of sympathy and 
regret.&nbsp; You might at that time, if you were a member of the Club, 
have heard Mr. Hall in his jaunty and somewhat defiant manner; you might 
have seen Mr. Tweed, riding in the midnight hour, with countenance vacant 
and locks awry, and have heard dropping from his lips, &lsquo;The public 
demands a victim.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so he proposed to charge upon Connolly, 
who had legal custody of the vouchers, the stealing and burning of 
them.&nbsp; He proposed to put some one else in the office of the 
Comptroller when Connolly should be crushed out of it, and so reconstruct 
the Ring and impose it a few years longer upon the people of this city. . .
. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sequel showed that the vouchers were taken by Haggerty, whom 
Mr. Connolly sought out and found, and prosecuted.&nbsp; Then, again, a 
little later, when it happened that Mr. Keyser swore that indorsements for 
$900,000 on warrants made in his name were forgeries, there was another 
raid made on the Comptroller&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; It was then filled by 
Mr. Green.&nbsp; The object was not to get rid of Mr. Connolly but of Mr. 
Green, and the men who caused the raid were Mayor Hall and Peter B. 
Sweeny.&nbsp; Now, what was the result of that?&nbsp; And I will say to 
this meeting that the sense of alarm that I had that morning lest the 
movement should mislead the public, was the motive that induced me to lay 
aside my business, go to the Broadway Bank and make a personal 
examination.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
105</span>&ldquo;What was the result of that?&nbsp; Why, that every one of 
these forged warrants were deposited, except one, to Woodward&rsquo;s 
account, and only one to Ingersoll, and that the proceeds were divided with
Tweed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen, these revelations throw a light upon what?&nbsp; 
Upon three false pretences in regard to these transactions, made by Mayor 
Hall under his own signature before the public, and two attempts to mislead
the public judgment as to the real authors of the crime.&nbsp; I do not 
wish to do injustice to Mayor Hall.&nbsp; He is a man experienced in 
criminal law.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; He is a man who is educated both in 
the drama and in the stirring scenes that are recorded in the actual crimes
of mankind in this country and in England, for I understand this has 
composed the greatest part of his business.&nbsp; Now I say that there is 
nothing in the melo-dramatic history of crime more remarkable than these 
two successive attempts of his to lay the crime to innocent men, if the 
object was not to screen men whom he knew to be guilty.&nbsp; And while I 
would not do any wrong or the slightest injustice to Mayor Hall, I say to 
him, as I do to you, that the history of these transactions puts him on his
explanation, and draws upon him a strong suspicion that he knew whereof he 
was acting.&nbsp; Did he mistake when he got the City Charter?&nbsp; Did he
mistake when he acted in the Board of Audit?&nbsp; Did he mistake when he 
accused Connolly of burning the vouchers?&nbsp; Has he been subject to a 
misfortune of mistakes at all times?&nbsp; Why does he stand to-day 
endeavoring to preserve that power?&nbsp; I will only say that if he was 
mistaken on these occasions he is a very unfortunate man, and has not 
acquired by the six years of practice in the District-Attorney&rsquo;s 
office that amount of sagacity in the pursuit of crime which we would 
naturally ascribe to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Richard B. Connolly</span> was born in the county of
Cork, in Ireland.&nbsp; His father was a village schoolmaster, and gave him
a good common school education.&nbsp; He was brought over to this country 
by an elder brother who had been here for several years.&nbsp; He embarked 
in politics at an early day, and was elected County Clerk before he could 
legally cast his vote.&nbsp; He soon <!-- page 106--><a 
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>made himself noted 
for his facility in making and breaking political promises, in consequence 
of which he was popularly called &ldquo;Slippery Dick.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave
considerable dissatisfaction to his party as County Clerk, and soon dropped
out of politics.&nbsp; A few years later, taking advantage of the divisions
of the Democratic party, he put himself forward as a candidate for the post
of State Senator, and was elected, as is charged by the newspaper press, by
the liberal use of bribery and ballot-box stuffing.&nbsp; He was charged 
with using his position to make money, and during his term at Albany was 
fiercely denounced for his course in this and other respects.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p104.jpg">
<img alt="RICHARD B. CONNOLLY." src="images/p104.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>About three years ago, he was appointed Comptroller of the Finance 
Department of the City of New York.&nbsp; At that time the real heads of 
the Finance Department were Peter B. Sweeny, City Chamberlain, and the late
County Auditor Watson, the latter of whom has been shown by the recent 
investigations to have been a wholesale plunderer of the public 
funds.&nbsp; The Comptroller was then a mere ornamental figure-head to the 
department.&nbsp; In a short while, however, Watson was accidentally 
killed; and Sweeny resigned, leaving Connolly master of the 
situation.&nbsp; He was suspected by Tweed, and in his turn distrusted the 
&ldquo;Boss.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is said that he resolved, however, to imitate 
his colleagues, and enrich himself at the cost of the public.&nbsp; He did 
well.&nbsp; In the short period of three years, this man, who had entered 
upon his office poor, became a millionaire.&nbsp; He made his son Auditor 
in the City Bureau, and gave the positions of Surrogate and Deputy Receiver
of Taxes to his two sons-in-law.&nbsp; All these three were men of the 
lowest intellectual capacity, and all three share in the suspicion which 
attaches to Connolly&rsquo;s administration of the office.&nbsp; The <i>New
York Tribune</i>, of October 25th, 1871, stated that a short time before he
became Comptroller, Connolly was sued for debt by Henry Felter, now a 
liquor merchant on Broadway, and <i>swore in court that he owned no 
property at all</i>.&nbsp; Under this statement the <i>Tribune</i> 
publishes a list of <i>a part</i> of Connolly&rsquo;s transactions in 
property since he became Comptroller, covering the sum of $2,300,691.</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
107</span><span class="smcap">Peter B. Sweeny</span> is the &ldquo;modest 
man&rdquo; of the Ring, and is popularly believed to carry the brains of 
that body in his head.&nbsp; He is regarded by the public as the real 
leader of the Ring, and the originator of, and prime, though secret mover 
in all its acts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p105.jpg">
<img alt="PETER B. SWEENY." src="images/p105.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Mr. Sweeny is of Irish parentage, though born in New York.&nbsp; His 
father kept a drinking saloon in Park Row, near the old Park Theatre, and 
it was in this choice retreat that the youth of Sweeny was passed.&nbsp; He
began his career as an errand boy in a law office.&nbsp; He subsequently 
studied law, and, in due time, was admitted to the bar.</p>
<p>A writer in <i>Every Saturday</i> thus sums up his career: &ldquo;He 
never obtained, and perhaps never sought, much business in his profession; 
but very soon after reaching manhood turned his attention to 
politics.&nbsp; The first office he held was that of Counsel to the 
Corporation, to which position he was elected by a handsome majority.&nbsp;
This station did not so much require in its occupant legal skill and legal 
ability, as an apt faculty for political manipulation; and in the work he 
had to do, Mr. Sweeny was eminently successful.&nbsp; From the Corporation 
office he went into the District Attorneyship, obtained leave of absence 
for some time, treated himself to a term of European travel, came home, and
resigned the post to which he had been chosen, and soon became City 
Chamberlain by the Mayor&rsquo;s appointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in this office that he did what gave him a national 
standing, and led many people into the notion that some good had come from 
the Tammany Nazareth.&nbsp; The Chamberlain was custodian, under the old 
charter, of all city moneys.&nbsp; Such portions of these funds as were not
required for immediate use, this official deposited in some of the banks, 
and the banks allowed interest, as is customary, on the weekly or monthly 
balance to his credit.&nbsp; Previous to Sweeny&rsquo;s time the 
Chamberlain had put this interest money into his own pocket&mdash;and a 
very handsome thing Mr. Devlin and his predecessors made out of the 
transaction.&nbsp; But Sweeny startled the political world, and caused a 
great sensation, by announcing that he should turn these interest receipts 
into the City Treasury.&nbsp; Tammany <!-- page 108--><a 
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>made a notable parade
of his honesty and public spirit, and the capital he gained in this way has
been his chief stock-in-trade for the last two or three years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the light of recent developments, Mr. Sweeny&rsquo;s 
course does not seem so purely disinterested as it once did.&nbsp; He was 
in full control of the city funds on the memorable Black Friday of two 
years ago last summer, and sworn testimony taken by a committee of Congress
shows that he had a share in the doings of that eventful day.&nbsp; To what
extent the money in his official charge was put at the service of the Wall 
street Ring, the country probably never will know; but the common belief of
New York is that Mr. Sweeny made a good deal of money out of his 
speculations on that occasion.&nbsp; That he has been more or less 
concerned with Fisk and Gould in various Erie Railway stock operations, is 
matter of general notoriety; as it is also that most of the lately-exposed 
fraudulent transactions in connection with the so-called new Court-House 
and other public buildings occurred during his incumbency of the 
Chamberlain&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; The greater part of those transactions 
yet brought into daylight refer to county affairs, it is true; but city and
county are one except in name, and we have only just begun to get at what 
are designated the city accounts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As has been already stated, he values himself on his brains, and 
the Ring adherents take him at that valuation.&nbsp; They believe him 
capable of finding a way out of the closest corner, and we suppose it is 
not to be doubted that he is a man of considerable ability.&nbsp; He has 
not many of the qualities of a popular politician; years ago he cut loose 
from his early engine-company associations; he is reserved and reticent at 
all times, and rarely seeks contact with the Democratic masses; he covets 
seclusion and respectability; apparently he has sought to be Warwick rather
than King, and his followers credit him with a masterly performance of the 
part.&nbsp; One of his earliest acts as President of the Park Commission 
was to oust Fred. Law Olmstead, and shelve Andrew H. Green, the actual 
creators of Central Park; but the whirligig of time has now put him into 
such a position that he cannot get a dollar of public money without the 
signature of Andrew H. Green.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
109</span>Since the disastrous defeat of Tammany and the Ring in the 
November elections, Mr. Sweeny has resigned his Presidency of the 
Department of Public Parks, and has retired to private life.&nbsp; He is a 
man of considerable wealth, and, though there is no evidence to convict him
of complicity with Tweed and Connolly in their frauds, the public suspect 
and distrust him, so that altogether, his retirement was a very wise and 
politic act.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;head devil&rdquo; of the Ring is <span class="smcap">William 
M. Tweed</span>, or, as he is commonly called, &ldquo;Boss 
Tweed.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is of Irish descent, and was born in the City of New
York.&nbsp; He was apprenticed to a chair-maker, to learn the trade, but 
never engaged legitimately in it after he became his own master.&nbsp; He 
finally became a member of Fire Company No. 6&mdash;known as &ldquo;Big 
Six,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old Tiger&rdquo;&mdash;the roughest and worst 
company in the city.&nbsp; He soon became its foreman.&nbsp; His attention 
was now turned to politics, and as he possessed considerable influence over
the &ldquo;roughs,&rdquo; he became a valuable man to the city 
politicians.&nbsp; As a compensation for his services, they allowed him to 
receive a small office, from which he pushed his way into the old Board of 
Supervisors, and eventually into the State Senate.&nbsp; Upon the 
inauguration of the New Charter, he became President of the Board of Public
Works, and the most prominent leader of the Ring.&nbsp; He is a man of 
considerable executive ability, and has known how to use his gifts for his 
own gain.&nbsp; In March, 1870, the <i>New York World</i> spoke of him as 
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tweed was worth less than nothing when he took to the trade 
of politics.&nbsp; Now he has great possessions, estimated all the way from
$5,000,000 to twice as much.&nbsp; We are sorry not to be able to give his 
own estimate, but, unluckily, he returns no income.&nbsp; But at least he 
is rich enough to own a gorgeous house in town and a sumptuous seat in the 
country, a stud of horses, and a set of palatial stables.&nbsp; His native 
modesty shrinks from blazoning abroad the exact extent of his present 
wealth, or the exact means by which it was acquired.&nbsp; His sensitive 
soul revolts even at the partial publicity of the income list.&nbsp; We are
tossed upon the boundless ocean of conjecture.&nbsp; But we do <!-- page 
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>know from 
his own reluctant lips that this public servant, who entered the public 
service a bankrupt, has become, by an entire abandonment of himself to the 
public good, &lsquo;one of the largest tax-payers in New York.&rsquo;&nbsp;
His influence is co-extensive with his cash.&nbsp; The docile Legislature 
sits at his feet, as Saul at the feet of Gamaliel, and waits, in reverent 
inactivity, for his signal before proceeding to action.&nbsp; He thrives on
percentages of pilfering, grows rich on the distributed dividends of 
rascality.&nbsp; His extortions are as boundless in their sum as in their 
ingenuity.&nbsp; Streets unopened profit him&mdash;streets opened put money
in his purse.&nbsp; Paving an avenue with poultice enriches 
him&mdash;taking off the poultice increases his wealth.&nbsp; His rapacity,
like the trunk of an elephant, with equal skill twists a fortune out of the
Broadway widening, and picks up dishonest pennies in the Bowery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1861, Mr. Tweed appeared in the courts of the city as a 
bankrupt.&nbsp; In 1871, his wealth is estimated at from $15,000,000, to 
$20,000,000.&nbsp; The manner in which he is popularly believed to have 
amassed this immense sum is thus described in a pamphlet recently issued in
New York:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While holding the position of State Senator he also held the 
position of Supervisor&mdash;was the leading spirit and President of the 
old Board of Supervisors, that has been denounced as the most scandalously 
corrupt body that ever disgraced a civilized community&mdash;and also the 
position of Deputy Street Commissioner.&nbsp; The first two be used to put 
money in his pocket, but the last was used mainly to enable him to keep a 
set of ruffians about him, who were paid out of the city treasury, and to 
afford lucrative positions to men who might be of service in promoting his 
political and pecuniary interests.&nbsp; By employing the same agencies 
that he had used to secure his own election, he gradually worked his 
particular friends into positions where he could use them, and then 
commenced a scheme for surrounding every department in the government of 
the city and county with a perfect network, which would enable himself and 
his confederates to appropriate to their own use the greater part of the 
city and county revenues.&nbsp; The new Court-House has been a mine <!-- 
page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>of 
wealth to these thieves from its very inception.&nbsp; The quarry from 
which the marble was supplied was bought by the gang for a mere nominal 
price, and has since netted them millions of dollars.&nbsp; The old fire 
engine-houses were turned over to &lsquo;Andy&rsquo; Garvey and other 
cronies of Tweed&rsquo;s at rents ranging from $50 to $150 a year, and some
of them have been let by these fellows as high as $5000 a year.&nbsp; The 
public schools, the different departments of the government, and the public
institutions under the control of the city authorities, all needed 
furniture, and Tweed started a furniture manufactory in connection with 
James H. Ingersoll, who has since achieved a notoriety as the most 
shameless thief among the fraternity of scoundrels whom we are now 
describing.&nbsp; Tweed&rsquo;s next step was to get control of a worthless
little newspaper called <i>The Transcript</i>, and then to introduce a bill
into the Legislature making this miserable little sheet the official organ 
of the City Government.&nbsp; This sheet receives over a $1,000,000 a year 
for printing the proceedings of the Common Council, but the proceedings of 
the corrupt Board of Supervisors are studiously concealed from the 
public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tweed&rsquo;s next step was to establish &lsquo;The New York 
Printing Company.&rsquo;&nbsp; This gives Tweed a pretext for rendering 
enormous bills for printing for the different departments of the City 
Government; and although the amount of work actually performed is only 
trifling, and consists mainly in printing blank forms and vouchers, still 
the amount annually paid out of the treasury to this company is something 
enormous&mdash;amounting during the year 1870 to over $2,800,000.&nbsp; Nor
is this all.&nbsp; When this company was first started, a portion of a 
building on Centre street was found sufficient for its accommodation.&nbsp;
Since then it has absorbed three of the largest printing establishments in 
the city, and also three or four smaller ones, and a lithographing 
establishment.&nbsp; Why have these extensive establishments been 
secured?&nbsp; Simply this: Insurance Companies, Steamboat Companies, Ferry
Companies, and other corporations require an enormous amount of 
printing.&nbsp; Each of these associations may be subjected to serious loss
and inconvenience, <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>by the passage of legislative enactments 
abridging the privileges they now enjoy, or requiring them to submit to 
some vexatious and expensive regulation.&nbsp; Hence, when they receive 
notice that &lsquo;The New York Printing Company&rsquo; is ready to do 
their printing, they know that they must consent, and pay the most 
exorbitant rate for the work done, or submit to Tweed&rsquo;s exactions 
during the next session of the Legislature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition to the Printing Company, Tweed has a 
&lsquo;Manufacturing Stationers&rsquo; Company,&rsquo; which furnishes all 
the stationery used in the public schools, the public institutions, and the
several departments of the City Government.&nbsp; This concern receives not
less than $3,000,000 a year out of the city treasury.&nbsp; As an 
illustration of the way they do things, we will cite one instance: During 
the month of April of the present year, an order was sent to this company 
for stationery for the County Bureau.&nbsp; In due time it was delivered, 
and consisted of about six reams of cap paper, and an equal quantity of 
letter paper, with a couple of reams of note paper.&nbsp; There were, also,
about two dozen penholders, four small ink bottles, such as could be bought
at retail for thirty-five or forty cents, a dozen small sponges for 
pen-wipers, half a dozen office rulers, and three dozen boxes of rubber 
bands of various sizes&mdash;the entire amount worth about fifty dollars at
retail.&nbsp; For this stationery, a bill of <i>ten thousand dollars</i> 
was rendered soon after, and was duly paid; and similar claims are 
presented for stationery for every bureau and department of the government,
almost every month throughout the year&mdash;and are always promptly paid, 
although persons having legitimate claims against the same appropriation 
could not obtain a dollar.&nbsp; But not content with the enormous amounts 
that are thus obtained under false pretences, Tweed even charges the city 
with the wages of the different persons employed in these several 
establishments, and makes a large percentage on the amounts thus drawn from
the Treasury.&nbsp; For instance: Charles E. Wilbour is President of the 
Printing Company and also of the Stationers&rsquo; Company, while Cornelius
Corson is the Secretary of both companies.&nbsp; Wilbour receives $3000 a 
year as Stenographer to the Bureau of Elections, $2500 as <!-- page 
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Stenographer
in the Superior Court, and $3500 a year for &lsquo;examining 
accounts&rsquo; that he has never seen.&nbsp; These several sums are drawn 
out of the County Bureau alone, and he holds an equal number of sinecure 
positions in the City Bureau.&nbsp; Corson is Chief of the Bureau of 
Elections, for which he receives $6000 a year; and he also receives $3500 
for &lsquo;examining&rsquo; the same accounts, for which Wilbour receives a
similar sum; while, like Wilbour, he has never seen the 
accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to carry on his immense operations, Tweed has had to avail 
himself from time to time of the assistance of his partners.&nbsp; He has 
always found them willing accomplices.&nbsp; These were J. H. Ingersoll, 
Andrew J. Garvey, and E. A. Woodward, all of whom have sought safety in 
flight.</p>
<p>J. H. Ingersoll is the son of a chair-dealer in the Bowery, and was 
Tweed&rsquo;s principal tool in defrauding the citizens.&nbsp; He in his 
turn &ldquo;operated&rdquo; through sub-firms, and was paid in 1869 and 
1870 the enormous sum of $5,691,144.26 for furniture and repairs to the new
Court House and the militia armories of the city.&nbsp; Much of this work 
was never done.&nbsp; For the work actually done only the legitimate price 
was paid; the rest of the enormous sum was divided between Tweed and 
Ingersoll.</p>
<p>Andrew J. Garvey is a plasterer by trade, and had a shop in the Third 
avenue.&nbsp; He is also an Irishman, and was a &ldquo;bunker&rdquo; of the
old fire department.&nbsp; During the years 1869 and 1870 he was paid 
$2,905,464.06 for repairing, plastering, painting and decorating the 
militia armories and the new Court-House.&nbsp; But a small part of this 
sum represents work honestly done.&nbsp; The rest is stolen money, of which
Tweed received his share.&nbsp; At the very first discovery of the frauds, 
Garvey fled from the city, and it is believed sailed for Europe to escape 
the punishment he dreaded.</p>
<p>E. A. Woodward was a deputy clerk to the Board of Supervisors, and as 
such received a moderate salary.&nbsp; As far as is known, he had no other 
means of acquiring money.&nbsp; He was at the beginning of the 
investigations the owner of a magnificent estate near Norwalk, Connecticut,
a partner in the firm of Vanderhoef &amp; Beatty, to the extent of $75,000;
and the owner of <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>property variously estimated at from $500,000 
to $1,000,000.&nbsp; It was charged by the New York papers that the 
endorsements of the name of Keyser &amp; Co. on warrants amounting to over 
$817,000, and which endorsements Mr. Keyser pronounced <i>forgeries</i>, 
were mainly the work of Woodward.&nbsp; The money drawn on the fraudulent 
warrants was divided between Woodward and Tweed.&nbsp; Conclusive evidence 
of this was afforded by Mr. Samuel J. Tilden, who, by a happy inspiration, 
made a personal examination of Tweed&rsquo;s bank account at the Broadway 
Bank, and there discovered that Tweed, Garvey, Ingersoll, and Woodward had 
divided $6,095,319.17 of the public funds between them.</p>
<p>Commenting upon this discovery, the New York <i>Tribune</i> remarks: 
&ldquo;Of the total amount of these warrants, $6,312,541.37, three 
dependents and tools of Mr. William M. Tweed deposited $5,710,913.38, and 
the New York Printing Company deposited $384,395.19, making 
$6,095,319.17.&nbsp; Further, $103,648.68 is believed to have been 
deposited by Ingersoll in a different bank, so that the whole amount of the
audit, except $113,583.52, was really collected by persons in connection 
with or in collusion with Tweed.&nbsp; Ingersoll collected $3,501,584.50 of
the warrants, and he received from Garvey, out of his collections, 
$47,744.68.&nbsp; Of that aggregate he paid over to Woodward $1,817,467.49,
or a little more than half of his whole receipts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garvey deposited warrants amounting to $1,177,413.72.&nbsp; He, 
Garvey, paid to Woodward $731,871.01, or over two-thirds of the whole 
amount of his receipts.&nbsp; Woodward deposited $1,032,715.76, and he 
received in checks from Ingersoll and Garvey enough of these collections to
make a total of $3,582,054.26.&nbsp; Of this amount he paid over 
$923,858.50 to Tweed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woodward was then, and is now, a deputy clerk to Young of the 
Board of Supervisors, on whose certification, according to Mayor 
Hall&rsquo;s resolution, as well as on that of Mr. Tweed, the bills were to
be paid.&nbsp; It is unknown to whom Woodward made other payments, but 
those he made to Tweed are established beyond doubt.&nbsp; The tickets 
accompanying the deposits are in the handwriting of Woodward, and the 
teller in the <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Broadway Bank swore that they were generally 
made by Woodward in person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including $104,333.64, Tweed received a handsome aggregate of 
$1,037,192.14.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manner in which the city warrants were identified is 
explained in the affidavit of Mr. Tilden.&nbsp; The first table is headed, 
&lsquo;County Liabilities.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is made up from the records in
the Comptroller&rsquo;s office and the warrants.&nbsp; The last contains 
all that there is (memoranda and endorsements) on the back of the 
warrants.&nbsp; Nearly all the vouchers of these bills were among those 
stolen on Sunday, September 10th, but the warrants were kept in a different
place, and are now in the Comptroller&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; The next table 
headed, &lsquo;Identification of Parties who received the Proceeds of the 
Warrants,&rsquo; is made up, as to the description of the warrants, from 
the books of the Comptroller&rsquo;s office, and from the warrants 
themselves, and the identification of the persons who deposited the 
warrants is made out from accounts of the entries, in the National Broadway
Bank.&nbsp; The asterisks against the amounts of the warrants in the fifth 
column indicate those of the Keyser warrants on which John H. Keyser 
alleges the endorsements were forged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those warrants which fell within the period of this account 
were collected by Woodward, <i>except one</i>, <i>and that one by 
Ingersoll</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly the transactions, taken together, were in the opinion
of the Acting Attorney-General, a conspiracy to defraud the county by means
of bills exaggerated many times, for work or services received, or for work
and services already paid for, or for accounts that were fictitious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result throws great light both on the stealing and burning of
the vouchers by Haggerty, the janitor of the building, appointed by the 
Chamberlain, and also upon the Keyser forgeries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woodward did not wait for the accumulation of evidence against 
him.&nbsp; He followed the example of Ingersoll and Garvey, and took 
flight, and at present his whereabouts is unknown.</p>
<p><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
116</span>Mr. Tilden&rsquo;s affidavit relating the facts of his discovery 
furnished evidence sufficient to justify the arrest of Mr. Tweed.&nbsp; The
Sheriff performed the farce of arresting the &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; in his 
office at the Department of Public Works.&nbsp; Bail was offered and 
accepted.&nbsp; The Sheriff treated the great defaulter with the utmost 
courtesy and deference, appearing before him, hat in hand, with a profusion
of servile bows.&nbsp; No absolute monarch could have been treated with 
greater reverence.&nbsp; The moral sense of the community was 
outraged.&nbsp; On the same day a poor wretch who had stolen a loaf of 
bread to keep his sick wife from starving was sentenced for theft.</p>
<p>Mr. Tweed attempted to explain away Mr. Tilden&rsquo;s discovery, but 
was met at once by that gentleman, who more than fastened his guilt upon 
him.&nbsp; Said Mr. Tilden:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fourth act in the conspiracy was the collection of the money 
and its division.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Who collected that money?&nbsp; 
We found upon investigation that every time Garvey collected $100,000 he 
paid 66 per cent. to Woodward, who paid Tweed 24 per cent. of it.&nbsp; 
(Laughter.)&nbsp; Sometimes Woodward paid a fraction above 24 per cent. to 
Tweed, sometimes a fraction below, but it never reached 25 per cent. nor 
fell to 23 per cent. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time Woodward collected money he paid over 24 per cent. to 
Tweed.&nbsp; The investigations in the Broadway Bank having begun without 
knowledge of the specific transactions to which they would relate, extend 
back through the whole of the year 1870, and it appears that about the same
transactions were going on in the four months of that year, and about the 
same division was made.&nbsp; Something like $200,000 or $240,000 was paid 
over to Tweed during those four months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have heard it said in some of the public presses that a 
gentleman who had an interview with Mr. Tweed had received the explanation 
that Mr. Woodward owed him large sums of borrowed money, and that when, in 
the course of his business arrangements with the city, he received these 
sums of money from the city, he simply paid it over to Mr. Tweed in 
satisfaction of his debts.&nbsp; That is a very fine theory.&nbsp; There is
only <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
117</span>one difficulty about it, and that is, these loans are not entered
on the bank account.&nbsp; Examine Mr. Tweed&rsquo;s bank account, and 
there is not $1000 in it except in city transactions.&nbsp; His whole 
private business during this time when he was depositing it&mdash;checks 
drawn upon city warrants amounted to $3,500,000&mdash;did not amount to 
$3000; therefore it results inevitably that whatever is taken from that 
account is city money, for there was nothing but city or county money in 
that bank.&nbsp; There were no private funds there.&nbsp; Where his 42 per 
cent. went I am unable to find out.&nbsp; It was probably transferred to 
some other bank in large checks for subdivision among the parties entitled 
thereto; but about that we know not.&nbsp; Now, gentlemen, that disposes of
the fourth act in the conspiracy, and the events justify me in saying that 
at the time the City Charter was passed I had no suspicion that the 
principal object in passing it was not to preserve political power, with 
the ordinary average benefits that usually accrue to its possessors.&nbsp; 
I had no suspicion that affairs were going on in this way.&nbsp; But it 
seems that these transactions were about one-half through; that there was 
about as much to be done after the new charter as had been done for sixteen
months previous under the old law; and that therefore the motive and object
of the new charter was not only to secure political power with its ordinary
average advantages, but also to conceal the immense amounts that had been 
already stolen, and to secure the opportunity of stealing an immense amount
that was in prospect before its passage.&nbsp; I say, then, that by the 
ordinary rules and principles of evidence, looking back to the beginning of
the transactions, no man can doubt that all this series of acts were parts 
of one grand conspiracy, not only for power, but for personal 
plunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have not the space to dwell further upon the villainies from which 
the city has suffered, but in parting with the Ring we cannot but regret, 
in the forcible language of the Committee of Seventy, that, &ldquo;Not an 
official implicated in these infamies has had the virtue to commit 
suicide.&rdquo;</p>

118</span>V.&nbsp; BROADWAY.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; HISTORICAL.</h3>
<p>To write the history of Broadway would require a volume, for it would be
the history of New York itself.&nbsp; The street was laid out in the days 
of the Dutch, and then, as now, began at the Bowling Green.&nbsp; By them 
it was called the &ldquo;Heere Straas,&rdquo; or High street.&nbsp; They 
built it up as far as Wall street, but in those days only the lower end was
of importance.&nbsp; The site of the Bowling Green was occupied by the 
Dutch fort and the church, and on the west side of it was the parade and 
the market place.&nbsp; Ere long several well-to-do merchants erected 
substantial dwellings on the same side, one of these belonging to no less a
personage than the Schout-Fiscal Van Dyck.&nbsp; The east side of Broadway,
during the rule of the Dutch, was thickly built up with dwellings of but 
one room, little better than hovels.&nbsp; Eventually, however, some of the
better class mechanics came there to reside, and erected better 
houses.&nbsp; Their gardens extended down to the marsh on Broad street, and
they cultivated their cabbages and onions with great success, where now the
bulls and bears of the stock and gold markets rage and roar.</p>
<p>Under the English rule Broadway improved rapidly.&nbsp; Substantial 
dwellings clustered around the Bowling Green.&nbsp; The first, and by far 
the most elegant of these, was the edifice still known as &ldquo;No. 1, 
Broadway,&rdquo; at present used as a hotel.&nbsp; It was built by 
Archibald Kennedy, then Collector of the Port of <!-- page 119--><a 
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>New York, and 
afterwards Earl of Cassilis, in the Scotch Peerage.&nbsp; In the colonial 
times it was frequented by the highest fashion of the city, and during the 
Revolution was the headquarters of the British General, Sir Henry 
Clinton.&nbsp; Other noted personages afterwards resided in it.&nbsp; This 
portion of Broadway escaped the destruction caused by the great fire of 
1776, and until about forty years ago preserved its ante-colonial 
appearance.</p>
<p>This fire destroyed all that part of the street that had been built 
above Morris street.&nbsp; After the Revolution it was rebuilt more 
substantially, and many of the most elegant residences in the city were to 
be found here, between Wall street and the Bowling Green.&nbsp; General 
Washington resided on the west side of Broadway, just below Trinity Church,
during a portion of his Presidential term.</p>
<p>In 1653, the Dutch built a wall across the island at the present Wall 
street.&nbsp; One of the main gates of this wall was on Broadway, just in 
front of the present Trinity Church.&nbsp; From this gate a public road, 
called the &ldquo;Highway,&rdquo; continued up the present line of the 
street to the &ldquo;Commons,&rdquo; now the City Hall Park, where it 
diverged into what is now Chatham street.&nbsp; In 1696 Trinity Church was 
erected.&nbsp; The churchyard north of the edifice had for some time 
previous been used as a burying ground.</p>
<p>Along the east side of Broadway, from Maiden lane to a point about 117 
feet north of Fulton street, was a pasture known as the 
&ldquo;Shoemaker&rsquo;s Pasture.&rdquo;&nbsp; It covered an area of 
sixteen acres, and was used in common by the shoemakers of the city for the
manufacture of leather, their tannery being located in a swampy section, 
near the junction of Maiden lane and William street.&nbsp; About 1720 the 
pasture was sold in lots, and Fulton and John streets were extended through
it.&nbsp; That part of the tract bounded by the present Broadway, Nassau, 
Fulton and Ann streets, was for many years occupied by a pleasure resort, 
known as &ldquo;Spring Garden.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tavern occupied the site of
the present <i>Herald</i> office.&nbsp; It was here, during the excitement 
preceding the Revolution, that the &ldquo;Sons of <!-- page 120--><a 
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Liberty&rdquo; had 
their head-quarters.&nbsp; They purchased the building, and named it 
&ldquo;Hampden Hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the scene of many a riot and 
public disturbance during those stirring times.&nbsp; It was occupied as a 
dwelling house from the close of the Revolution until 1830, when it was 
converted into a Museum by John Scudder.&nbsp; In 1840 Phineas T. Barnum 
became the owner of the building and Museum.&nbsp; After the destruction of
the Museum by fire in 1864, Mr. James Gordon Bennett purchased the site, 
and erected upon it the magnificent office of <i>The Herald</i>.</p>
<p>Trinity Church Farm lay along the west side of Broadway, north of Fulton
street.&nbsp; It was divided into lots in 1760, and between that time and 
1765, the present St. Paul&rsquo;s Church was erected on the lower end of 
it.&nbsp; The street forming the northern boundary of the churchyard was 
named Vesey, in honor of a former pastor of Trinity.</p>
<p>In 1738 a public market, 156 feet long, and 20 feet 3&frac12; inches 
wide, was erected in the middle of Broadway, opposite the present Liberty, 
then Crown street.&nbsp; It remained there until 1771, when it was removed 
as a public nuisance.</p>
<p>By the opening of the present century, Broadway had extended above the 
present City Hall Park, which had been enclosed as a pleasure ground in 
1785.&nbsp; It was taken up along its upper portion mainly with cottages, 
and buildings of a decidedly rustic character.&nbsp; In 1805 the street was
paved in front of the Park, and in 1803 the present City Hall was begun on 
the site of the old Poor House.&nbsp; It was completed in 1812.&nbsp; The 
principal hotels, and many of the most elegant residences, were to be found
at this time on both sides of Broadway between Chambers street and Wall 
street.&nbsp; In 1810-12 Washington Hall was erected on the southeast 
corner of Reade street.&nbsp; It was the head-quarters of the old Federal 
Party, and was subsequently used as a hotel.&nbsp; It was afterwards 
purchased by Mr. A. T. Stewart, who erected on its site his palatial 
wholesale store, which extends along Broadway to Chambers street.&nbsp; 
About the year 1820, the dry goods merchants began to locate themselves on 
the west side of Broadway near Reade street.</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
121</span>On the west side of Broadway, above Duane street, was the 
celebrated Rutgers&rsquo; estate, consisting of a fine mansion and large 
and elaborately laid out grounds.&nbsp; The house was built by Anthony 
Rutgers in 1730, and occupied by him until his death in 1750.&nbsp; After 
his death the property was converted into a pleasure garden, known as 
&ldquo;The Ranelagh.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was kept by a Mr. John Jones until a 
few years before the Revolution.&nbsp; It was a famous resort for the 
better classes.&nbsp; A complete band was in attendance every Monday and 
Thursday evening during the summer, and dancing was carried on in a large 
hall which had been erected in the garden.&nbsp; In 1770, the estate was 
sold.&nbsp; Five acres, embracing the orchard, were purchased by an 
association, and in 1773, the New York Hospital was begun on this 
site.&nbsp; In 1869 the hospital was removed higher up town, the land was 
sold, and Pearl street was extended through the hospital grounds.</p>
<p>Between 1774 and 1776 a reservoir for supplying the city with water was 
erected on the east side of Broadway, near the southeast corner of White 
street.&nbsp; The water was pumped into the reservoir from wells, and was 
distributed through the city in wooden pipes.&nbsp; At this time the 
streets were not opened in this vicinity, and the reservoir is described as
standing on an &ldquo;elevated hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1810 the reservoir 
property was sold in lots, the highest price paid per lot being $3000.</p>
<p>By 1818 Broadway was built up to above Duane street, and in 1826 the 
Free Masons erected a handsome Gothic Hall, on the east side, between Duane
and Pearl streets.&nbsp; The street continued to grow, and about 1830 
extended above Canal street.&nbsp; In 1836-39, the Society Library erected 
a handsome building on the west side, between Howard and Grand 
streets.&nbsp; In 1853, they sold the building, which fronts sixty feet on 
Broadway, to D. Appleton &amp; Co., Publishers.&nbsp; By the year 1825, 
when gas was introduced into the city south of Canal street, the west side 
of Broadway above Chambers street was the fashionable shopping mart.&nbsp; 
The cross streets were used mainly for residences, and these daily poured a
throng of pedestrians into Broadway, making it the fashionable 
promenade.&nbsp; At this time long rows <!-- page 122--><a 
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>of poplar trees lined
the sidewalks.&nbsp; The principal hotels and theatres, restaurants, and 
pleasure resorts were to be found along the street, and Broadway became 
what it has since been, a miniature of the great city of which it is the 
chief artery.</p>
<p>After passing Canal street, along which, in the early part of the 
present century, a considerable stream, spanned at Broadway by a stone 
bridge, flowed across the island to the Hudson, Broadway grew 
rapidly.&nbsp; In 1820 the site of the St. Nicholas Hotel was occupied by a
store, four dwelling houses, and a coach factory, the last of which was 
sunk below the level of the street.&nbsp; Back of the present hotel was a 
hill on which were the remains of an earthwork, thrown up during the 
Revolution.&nbsp; The hotel was erected in 1852.&nbsp; In 1823 the site of 
the Metropolitan Hotel was vacant.&nbsp; The block between Prince and 
Houston streets, on the west side, was occupied by two large houses, a 
garden, and several shanties.</p>
<p>On the east side of Broadway, above Bleecker street, was a fine pleasure
resort, called &ldquo;Vauxhall Garden.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was opened by a 
Frenchman named Delacroix, about the beginning of this century.&nbsp; The 
location was then beyond the city limits.&nbsp; The Bible House and Cooper 
Institute mark its eastern boundary.&nbsp; Lafayette Place was cut through 
it in 1837.&nbsp; Astor Place was its northern boundary, and the site of 
the Astor Library was within its limits.&nbsp; The entrance to the grounds 
was on Broadway.</p>
<p>From Astor Place, originally known as Art street, the progress of 
Broadway was rapid.&nbsp; By the year 1832, it was almost entirely built up
to Union Square.&nbsp; In 1846, Grace Church was erected, the original 
edifice, built about 1800, having stood at the corner of Broadway and 
Rector streets, just below Trinity Church.&nbsp; In 1850, the Union Place 
Hotel, corner of Broadway and Fourteenth street, and in 1852, the St. Denis
Hotel, corner of Broadway and Eleventh street, were built.&nbsp; Union 
Square was laid off originally in 1815, and in its present shape in 
1832.</p>
<p>Above Union Square, Broadway was originally known as the Bloomingdale 
road, and was lined with farms and country seats.&nbsp; <!-- page 123--><a 
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Madison Square was 
laid off about 1841.&nbsp; The Fifth Avenue Hotel was built about fifteen 
years later, and the remainder of the street is of very recent growth, 
possessing but little local interest.</p>
<p>Broadway has grown with the extension of the city northward.&nbsp; The 
upper blocks of buildings have always been dwelling houses or shanties, and
these have given way steadily to the pressure of business below them.&nbsp;
In a few years the entire street, from the Central Park to the Bowling 
Green, will be taken up with substantial and elegant structures suited to 
the growing needs of the great city.&nbsp; From the imperfect sketch of its
history here presented, the reader will see that the growth of the street 
is divided into distinct periods.&nbsp; Under the Dutch it was built as far
as Wall street.&nbsp; The next 100 years carried it to the Park, from which
it extended to Duane street, reaching that point about the close of the 
Revolution.&nbsp; By the opening of the present century it had reached 
Canal street.&nbsp; Its next advance was to Astor Place.&nbsp; Thence it 
passed on to a point above Union Square, and thence by a rapid growth to 
the neighborhood of the Central Park.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; DESCRIPTIVE.</h3>
<p>The most wonderful street in the universe is Broadway.&nbsp; It is a 
world within itself.&nbsp; It extends throughout the entire length of the 
island, and is about sixty feet in width.&nbsp; Its chief attractions, 
however, lie between the Bowling Green and Thirty-fourth street.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It begins at the Bowling Green.&nbsp; From this point it extends in a 
straight line to Fourteenth street and Union Square.&nbsp; Below Wall 
street it is mainly devoted to the &ldquo;Express&rdquo; business, the 
headquarters and branch offices of nearly all the lines in the country 
centring here.&nbsp; Opposite Wall street, and on the west side of 
Broadway, is Trinity Church and its graveyard.&nbsp; From Wall street to 
Ann street, Insurance Companies, Real <!-- page 124--><a 
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Estate Agents, Banks,
Bankers and Brokers predominate.&nbsp; At the southeast corner of Ann 
street is the magnificent <i>Herald</i> office, and adjoining it the Park 
Bank.&nbsp; Both buildings are of white marble, and the latter is one of 
the grandest in the Union.&nbsp; Immediately opposite are St. Paul&rsquo;s 
Church and graveyard, just above which is the massive granite front of the 
Astor House, occupying an entire block, from Vesey to Barclay 
streets.&nbsp; On the right hand side of the street, at the lower end of 
the Park, is the unfinished structure of the new Post Office, which will be
one of the principal ornaments of the city.&nbsp; In the rear of this are 
the Park, and the City Hall.&nbsp; Back of the City Hall, and fronting on 
Chambers street, is the new County Court-House, which proved such a gold 
mine to the &ldquo;Ring.&rdquo;&nbsp; Across the Park you may see Park Row 
and Printing-House Square, in which are located the offices of nearly all 
the great &ldquo;dailies,&rdquo; <!-- page 125--><a 
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>and of many of the 
weekly papers.&nbsp; Old Tammany Hall once stood on this square at the 
corner of Frankfort street, but its site is now occupied by the offices of 
<i>The Sun</i> and <i>Brick Pomeroy&rsquo;s Democrat&mdash;Arcades 
ambo</i>.</p>

<img alt="A. T. STEWART&rsquo;S WHOLESALE STORE." src="images/p125.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Beyond the City Hall, at the northeast corner of Chambers street and 
Broadway, is &ldquo;Stewart&rsquo;s marble dry goods palace,&rdquo; as it 
is called.&nbsp; This is the <i>wholesale</i> department of the great house
of A. T. Stewart &amp; Co., and extends from Chambers to Reade 
street.&nbsp; The <i>retail</i> department of this firm is nearly two miles
higher up town.&nbsp; Passing along, one sees in glancing up and down the 
cross streets, long rows of marble, iron, and brown stone warehouses, 
stretching away for many blocks on either hand, and affording proof 
positive of the vastness and success of the business transacted in this 
locality.&nbsp; To the right we catch a distant view of the squalor and 
misery of the Five Points.&nbsp; On the right hand side of the street, 
between Leonard <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>street and Catharine lane, is the imposing 
edifice of the New York Life Insurance Company, one of the noblest 
buildings ever erected by private enterprise.&nbsp; It is constructed of 
white marble.</p>
<p>Crossing Canal street, the widest and most conspicuous we have yet 
reached, we notice, on the west side, at the corner of Grand street, the 
beautiful marble building occupied by the <i>wholesale</i> department of 
Lord &amp; Taylor, rivals of Stewart in the dry-goods trade.&nbsp; The 
immense brown stone building immediately opposite, is also a wholesale 
dry-goods house.&nbsp; Between Broome and Spring streets, on the west side,
are the marble and brown stone buildings of the St. Nicholas Hotel.&nbsp; 
Immediately opposite is the Theatre Comique.&nbsp; On the northwest corner 
of Spring street is the Prescott House.&nbsp; On the southwest corner of 
Prince street is Ball &amp; Black&rsquo;s palatial jewelry store.&nbsp; 
Diagonally opposite is the Metropolitan Hotel, in the rear of which is the 
theatre known as Niblo&rsquo;s Garden.&nbsp; In the block above the 
Metropolitan is the Olympic Theatre.&nbsp; On the west side, between 
Bleecker and Amity streets, is the huge Grand Central Hotel, one of the 
most conspicuous objects on the street.&nbsp; Two blocks above, on the same
side, is the New York Hotel, immediately opposite which are Lina 
Edwin&rsquo;s and the Globe Theatres.&nbsp; On the east side of the street,
and covering the entire block bounded by Broadway and Fourth avenue, and 
Ninth and Tenth streets, is an immense iron structure painted white.&nbsp; 
This is Stewart&rsquo;s retail store.&nbsp; It is always filled with ladies
engaged in &ldquo;shopping,&rdquo; and the streets around it are blocked 
with carriages.&nbsp; Throngs of elegantly and plainly dressed buyers pass 
in and out, and the whole scene is animated and interesting.&nbsp; Just 
above &ldquo;Stewart&rsquo;s,&rdquo; on the same side, is Grace Church, 
attached to which is the parsonage.&nbsp; At the southwest corner of 
Eleventh street, is the St. Denis Hotel, and on the northwest corner is the
magnificent iron building of the &ldquo;Methodist Book Concern,&rdquo; the 
street floor of which is occupied by McCreery, one of the great dry-goods 
dealers of the city.&nbsp; At the northeast corner of Thirteenth street, is
Wallack&rsquo;s Theatre.&nbsp; The upper end of the same block is occupied 
by the Union Square Theatre and a small hotel.</p>

</a></p>
<p>At Fourteenth street we enter Union Square, once a fashionable place of 
residence, but now giving way to business houses and hotels.&nbsp; Broadway
passes around it in a northwesterly direction.&nbsp; On the west side of 
Union Square, at the southwest corner of Fifteenth street, is the famous 
establishment of Tiffany &amp; Co., an iron building, erected at an immense
cost, and filled with the largest and finest collection of jewelry, 
articles of <i>vertu</i>, and works of art in America.&nbsp; In the middle 
of the block above, occupying the ground floor of Decker&rsquo;s Piano 
Building, is <i>Brentano&rsquo;s</i>, the &ldquo;great literary 
headquarters&rdquo; of New York.</p>
<p>Leaving Union Square behind us, we pass into Broadway again at 
Seventeenth street.&nbsp; On the west side, occupying the entire block from
Eighteenth to Nineteenth streets, is a magnificent building of white marble
used by a number of retail merchants.&nbsp; The upper end, comprising 
nearly one half of the block, is occupied by Arnold, Constable &amp; Co., 
one of the most fashionable retail dry-goods houses.&nbsp; At the southwest
corner of Twentieth street, is the magnificent iron <i>retail</i> dry-goods
store of Lord &amp; Taylor&mdash;perhaps the most popular house in the <!--
page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>city 
with residents.&nbsp; The &ldquo;show windows&rdquo; of this house are 
always filled with a magnificent display of the finest goods, and attract 
crowds of gazers.</p>
<p>At Twenty-third street, Broadway crosses Fifth avenue obliquely, going 
toward the northwest.&nbsp; At the northwest corner of Twenty-third street,
and extending to Twenty-fourth street, is the Fifth Avenue Hotel, built of 
white marble, one of the finest and handsomest buildings of its kind in the
world.&nbsp; Just opposite is Madison Square, extending from Fifth to 
Madison avenues.&nbsp; The block from Twenty-fourth to Twenty-fifth streets
is occupied by the Albemarle and Hoffman Houses, in the order named, both 
of white marble.&nbsp; Just opposite, at the junction of Broadway and Fifth
avenue, is a handsome granite obelisk, with appropriate ornaments in 
bronze, erected to the memory of General W. J. Worth.&nbsp; Immediately 
beyond this is the Worth House, fronting on Broadway and Fifth 
avenue.&nbsp; The vicinity of Madison Square is the brightest, prettiest, 
and liveliest portion of the great city.&nbsp; At the southwest corner of 
Twenty-sixth street is the St. James&rsquo; Hotel, also of white marble, 
and just opposite is the &ldquo;Stevens&rsquo; House,&rdquo; an immense 
building constructed on the French plan of &ldquo;flats,&rdquo; and rented 
in suites of apartments.&nbsp; Between Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth 
streets, on the west side, is the Coleman House.&nbsp; At the southeast 
corner of Twenty-ninth street is the Sturtevant House.&nbsp; At the 
northeast corner of Twenty-ninth street is the Gilsey House, a magnificent 
structure of iron, painted white.&nbsp; Diagonally opposite is Wood&rsquo;s
Museum.&nbsp; At the southeast corner of Thirty-first street is the Grand 
Hotel, a handsome marble building.&nbsp; The only hotel of importance above
this is the St. Cloud, at the southeast corner of Forty-second street.</p>
<p>At Thirty-fourth street, Broadway crosses Sixth avenue, and at 
Forty-fourth street it crosses Seventh avenue, still going in a 
northwesterly direction.&nbsp; It is but little improved above 
Thirty-fourth street, though it is believed the next few years will witness
important changes in this quarter.</p>
<p>There are no street car tracks on Broadway below Fourteenth street, and 
in that section &ldquo;stages,&rdquo; or omnibuses, monopolize <!-- page 
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>the public 
travel.&nbsp; Several hundreds of these traverse the street from the lower 
ferries as far as Twenty-third street, turning off at various points into 
the side streets and avenues.</p>

<a href="images/p129.jpg">
<img alt="BROADWAY, AS SEEN FROM THE ST. NICHOLAS HOTEL."

</a></p>
<p>Below Twenty-ninth street, and especially below Union Square, the street
is built up magnificently.&nbsp; From Union Square to the Bowling Green, a 
distance of three miles, it is lined on each side with magnificent 
structures of marble, brown, <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>Portland, and Ohio stones, granite, and 
iron.&nbsp; No street in the world surpasses it in the grandeur and variety
of its architectural display.&nbsp; Some of the European cities contain 
short streets of greater beauty, and some of our American cities contain 
limited vistas as fine, but the great charm, the chief claim of Broadway to
its fame, is the <i>extent</i> of its grand display.&nbsp; For three miles 
it presents an unbroken vista, and the surface is sufficiently undulating 
to enable one to command a view of the entire street from any point between
Tenth street and the Bowling Green.&nbsp; Seen from one of the hotel 
balconies, the effect is very fine.&nbsp; The long line of the magnificent 
thoroughfare stretches away into the far distance.&nbsp; The street is 
thronged with a dense and rapidly moving mass of men, animals, and vehicles
of every description.&nbsp; The effect is unbroken, but the different 
colors of the buildings give to it a variety that is startling and 
pleasing.&nbsp; In the morning the throng is all pouring one way&mdash;down
town; and in the afternoon the tide flows in the opposite direction.&nbsp; 
Everybody is in a hurry at such times.&nbsp; Towards afternoon the crowd is
more leisurely, for the promenaders and loungers are out.&nbsp; Then 
Broadway is in its glory.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the throng of vehicles is so dense that the streets are 
quickly &ldquo;jammed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Carriages, wagons, carts, omnibuses, 
and trucks are packed together in the most helpless confusion.&nbsp; At 
such times the police are quickly on hand, and take possession of the 
street.&nbsp; The scene is thrilling.&nbsp; A stranger feels sure that this
struggling mass of horses and vehicles can never be made to resume their 
course in good order, without loss of life or limb to man or beast, or to 
both, and the shouts and oaths of the drivers fairly bewilder him.&nbsp; In
a few minutes, however, he sees a squad of gigantic policemen dash into the
throng of vehicles.&nbsp; They are masters of the situation, and wo to the 
driver who dares disobey their sharp and decisive commands.&nbsp; The 
shouts and curses cease, the vehicles move on one at a time in the routes 
assigned them, and soon the street is clear again, to be 
&ldquo;blocked&rdquo; afresh, perhaps, in a similar manner in less than an 
hour.&nbsp; Upwards of 20,000 vehicles daily traverse this great 
thoroughfare.</p>
<p><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
131</span>It is always a difficult matter for a pedestrian to cross the 
lower part of Broadway in the busy season.&nbsp; Ladies, old persons, and 
children find it impossible to do so without the aid of the police, whose 
duty it is to make a passage for them through the crowd of vehicles.&nbsp; 
A bridge was erected in 1866 at the corner of Fulton street, for the 
purpose of enabling pedestrians to pass over the heads of the throng in the
streets.&nbsp; Few persons used it, however, except to witness the 
magnificent panorama of the street, and it was taken down.</p>
<p>Seen from the lofty spire of Trinity Church, the street presents a 
singular appearance.&nbsp; The perspective is closed by Grace Church, at 
Tenth street.&nbsp; The long lines of passers and carriages take distinct 
shapes, and seem like immense black bands moving slowly in opposite 
directions.&nbsp; The men seem like pigmies, and the horses like 
dogs.&nbsp; There is no confusion, however.&nbsp; The eye readily masses 
into one line all going in the same direction.&nbsp; Each one is hurrying 
on at the top of his speed, but from this lofty perch they all seem to be 
crawling at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</p>
<p>The display in the windows of the Broadway stores is rich, beautiful, 
and tempting.&nbsp; Jewels, silks, satins, laces, ribbons, household goods,
silverware, toys, paintings, in short, rare, costly, and beautiful objects 
of every description greet the gazer on every hand.&nbsp; All that is 
necessary for the comfort of life, all that ministers to luxury and taste, 
can be found here in the great thoroughfare.&nbsp; And it is a mistake to 
suppose, as many persons do, that &ldquo;Broadway prices&rdquo; are higher 
than those of other localities.&nbsp; The best goods in the city are to be 
found here, and they bring only what they are worth, and no more.&nbsp; Yet
it must not be supposed that all Broadway dealers are models of 
honesty.&nbsp; Everything has its price in the great street&mdash;even 
virtue and honesty.&nbsp; By the side of merchants whose names are 
synonymous for integrity are to be found some of the most cunning and 
successful scoundrels.&nbsp; Broadway is an eminently cheerful 
street.&nbsp; On every hand one sees evidences of prosperity and 
wealth.&nbsp; No unsuccessful man can remain in the street.&nbsp; Poverty 
and failure have no place there.&nbsp; Even sin shows its most attractive 
guise in Broadway.</p>

<p><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
133</span>The side-walks are always crowded, even in the summer, when 
&ldquo;everybody is out of town,&rdquo; and this throng of passers-by 
constitutes one of the most attractive features of the scene.&nbsp; Every 
class, every shade of nationality and character, is represented here.&nbsp;
America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and even Oceanica, each has its 
representatives.&nbsp; High and low, rich and poor, pass along at a rate of
speed peculiar to New York, and positively bewildering to a stranger.&nbsp;
No one seems to think of any one but himself, and each one jostles his 
neighbor or brushes by him with an indifference amusing to behold.&nbsp; 
Fine gentlemen in broadcloth, ladies in silks and jewels, and beggars in 
squalid rags, are mingled in true Republican confusion.&nbsp; The bustle 
and uproar are very great, generally making it impossible to converse in an
ordinary tone.&nbsp; From early morn till after midnight the throng pours 
on.</p>
<p>At night the scene is different, but still brilliant.&nbsp; The vehicles
in the street consist almost entirely of carriages and omnibuses, each with
its lamps of different colors.&nbsp; They go dancing down the long vista 
like so many fire-flies.&nbsp; The shop-windows are brightly lighted, and 
the monster hotels pour out a flood of radiance from their myriads of 
lamps.&nbsp; Here and there a brilliant reflector at the door of some 
theatre, sends its dazzling white rays streaming along the street for 
several blocks.&nbsp; Below Canal street Broadway is dark and silent, but 
above that point it is as bright as day, and fairly alive with 
people.&nbsp; Those who are out now are mostly bent on pleasure, and the 
street resounds with cheerful voices and merry laughter, over which 
occasionally rises a drunken howl.&nbsp; Strains of music or bursts of 
applause float out on the night air from places of amusement, not all of 
which are reputable.&nbsp; Here and there a crowd has collected to listen 
to the music and songs of some of the wandering minstrels with which the 
city abounds.&nbsp; Gaudily painted transparencies allure the unwary to the
vile concert saloons in the cellars below the street.&nbsp; The restaurants
and <i>caf&eacute;s</i> are ablaze with light, and are liberally patronized
by the lovers of good living.&nbsp; Here and there, sometimes alone, and 
sometimes in couples, you see women, mainly young, and all <!-- page 
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>flashily 
dressed, walking rapidly, with a peculiar gait, and glancing quickly but 
searchingly at every man they pass.&nbsp; You can single them out at a 
glance from the respectable women who happen to be out alone at this 
time.&nbsp; They are the &ldquo;street walkers,&rdquo; seeking companions 
from among the passers-by.&nbsp; Some of them are mere children, and the 
heart aches to see the poor creatures at their fearful work.&nbsp; The 
police do not allow these women to stop and converse with men on Broadway, 
and when they find a companion they turn off promptly into a side street, 
and disappear with him in the darkness.</p>
<p>Towards eleven o&rsquo;clock the theatres pour out their throngs of 
spectators, who come to swell the crowd on Broadway, and for a little while
the noise and confusion are almost as great as in the day.&nbsp; Then the 
restaurants will close, and the street will gradually become deserted and 
dark, tenanted only by the giant policemen; and for a few hours the great 
city will be wrapped in silence and slumber.</p>
<h2><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
135</span>VI.&nbsp; SOCIETY.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; ANALYTICAL.</h3>
<p>All the world over, poverty is a misfortune.&nbsp; In New York it is a 
crime.&nbsp; Here, as in no other place in the country, men struggle for 
wealth.&nbsp; They toil, they suffer privations, they plan and scheme, and 
execute with a persistency that often wins the success they covet.&nbsp; 
The chief effort of every man and woman in the great city is to secure 
wealth.&nbsp; Man is a social being&mdash;woman much more so&mdash;and here
wealth is an absolute necessity to the enjoyment of social pleasures.&nbsp;
Society here is organized upon a pecuniary basis, and stands not as it 
should upon the personal merits of those who compose it, but upon a pile of
bank-books.&nbsp; In other cities, poor men, who are members of families 
which command respect for their talents or other admirable qualities, or 
who have merit of their own sufficient to entitle them to such recognition,
are welcomed into what are called the &ldquo;Select Circles&rdquo; with as 
much cordiality as though they were millionaires.&nbsp; In New York, 
however, men and women are judged by their bank accounts.&nbsp; The most 
illiterate boor, the most unprincipled knave finds the door of fashion open
to him, while St. Peter himself, if he came &ldquo;without purse or 
scrip,&rdquo; would see it closed in his face.</p>
<p>Society in New York is made up of many elements, the principal of which 
it is proposed to examine, but, unfortunately, wealth is the one thing 
needful in most of the classes into which it is divided.&nbsp; Nor is this 
strange.&nbsp; The majority of <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>fashionable people have never known any of the
arts and refinements of civilization except those which mere wealth can 
purchase.&nbsp; Money raised them from the dregs of life, and they are firm
believers in it.&nbsp; Without education, without social polish, they see 
themselves courted and fawned upon for their wealth, and they naturally 
suppose that there is nothing else &ldquo;good under the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who claim precedence base their demand upon their descent from the
original Dutch settlers, and style themselves &ldquo;the old 
Knickerbockers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The majority of these are very wealthy, and 
have inherited their fortunes from their ancestors.&nbsp; They are owners 
of valuable real estate, much of which is located in the very heart of the 
city.&nbsp; The incomes derived from such property are large and 
certain.&nbsp; They are frequently persons of cultivation, and were it not 
for their affectation of superiority, would, as a class, be decidedly 
clever people, even if many of them are stupid.&nbsp; They make an effort 
to have their surroundings as clumsy and as old-fashioned as possible, as a
mark of their Dutch descent.&nbsp; They sport crests and coats of arms such
as the simple old Dutchmen of New Amsterdam never dreamed of; and rely more
upon the merits of their forefathers than upon their own.&nbsp; They are 
extremely exclusive, and rarely associate with any but those who can 
&ldquo;show as pure a pedigree.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their disdain of those whose 
families are not as &ldquo;old&rdquo; as their own is oftentimes amusing, 
and subjects them to ridicule, which they bear with true Dutch 
stolidity.&nbsp; They improve in their peculiar qualities with each 
generation, and the present pompous Knickerbocker who drives in the Park in
solemn state in his heavy chariot, and looks down with disdain upon all 
whose blood is not as Dutch as his own, is a very different personage from 
his great ancestor, the original Knickerbocker, who hawked fish about the 
streets of New Amsterdam, or tanned leather down in &ldquo;the 
swamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>
<a href="images/p137.jpg">
<img alt="A FASHIONABLE PROMENADE ON FIFTH AVENUE." src="images/p137.jpg" 
/>
</a></p>
<p>Strange to say, the Knickerbocker class receives fresh additions every 
year.&nbsp; Each new comer has a <i>Van</i> to his name, and can show a 
string of portraits of yellow-faced worthies, in leather breeches, and 
ruffles, and wigs, which he points to with <!-- page 138--><a 
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>pride as his 
&ldquo;ancestors.&rdquo;&nbsp; The statistician would be sorely perplexed 
in attempting to ascertain the number of Dutch settlers in New Amsterdam 
were he to trace back the pedigrees of the present Knickerbockers, for if 
the claims of the present generation be admitted, one of two things is 
sure&mdash;either the departed Dutchmen must have been more &ldquo;numerous
fathers&rdquo; than they cared to admit at the time, or the original 
population has been underestimated.</p>
<p>The next in order are those who, while making no boast of family, are 
persons who have inherited large wealth from several generations of 
ancestors.&nbsp; Freed from the necessity of earning their livings, they 
have an abundance of leisure in which to cultivate the &ldquo;small sweet 
courtesies of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are neither shoddyites nor snobs, and
while there are many who do no credit to their class, they constitute one 
of the pleasantest portions of metropolitan society.&nbsp; They furnish 
some of the most agreeable men, and some of the most beautiful and charming
women in the city.&nbsp; Their homes are elegant, and abound in evidences 
of the taste of their owners, who spend their money liberally in support of
literature and the arts.&nbsp; Here are to be found some of the rarest 
works of European and American masters.&nbsp; Unfortunately this class of 
New Yorkers is not very large.&nbsp; It is destined to increase, however, 
with the growth of wealth in the city.&nbsp; Good men, who have begun where
the forefathers of these people started, will constantly contribute their 
children to swell this class, in which will always be collected those who 
unite true merit to great wealth, those who are proud of their country and 
its institutions, contented with its customs, and possessed of too much 
good sense to try to add to their importance by a ridiculous assumption of 
&ldquo;aristocratic birth,&rdquo; or a pitiful imitation of the manners of 
the great of other lands.</p>
<p>The third class may be said to consist of those who value culture and 
personal excellence above riches.&nbsp; There is not much individual wealth
in this class, but its members may be regarded as &ldquo;persons in 
comfortable circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are better educated, have more
correct tastes, and do the most to give to New York society its best and 
most attractive features.&nbsp; <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>It is a class to which merit is a sure 
passport.&nbsp; It is modest and unassuming, free from ostentatious parade,
and, fortunately, is growing rapidly.&nbsp; It is made up of professional 
men of all kinds, clergymen, lawyers, poets, authors, physicians, painters,
sculptors, journalists, scientific men, and actors, and their 
families.&nbsp; Its tone is vigorous and healthy, and it is sufficiently 
free from forms to make it independent, and possessed of means enough to 
enable it to pursue its objects without hindrance.</p>
<p>The remainder of those who constitute what is called society are the 
&ldquo;New Rich,&rdquo; or as they are sometimes termed, the 
&ldquo;Shoddyites.&rdquo;&nbsp; They constitute the majority of the 
fashionables, and their influence is felt in every department of domestic 
life.&nbsp; They are ridiculed by every satirist, yet they increase.&nbsp; 
Every year makes fresh accessions to their ranks, and their follies and 
extravagances multiply in proportion.&nbsp; They occupy the majority of the
mansions in the fashionable streets, crowd the public thoroughfares and the
Park with their costly and showy equipages, and flaunt their wealth so 
coarsely and offensively in the faces of their neighbors, that many good 
people have come to believe that riches and vulgarity are 
inseparable.&nbsp; They make themselves the most conspicuous, and are at 
once accepted by strangers as the &ldquo;best society&rdquo; of the 
metropolis.</p>
<p>They are almost without exception persons who have risen from the 
ranks.&nbsp; This is not to their discredit.&nbsp; On the contrary, every 
American is proud to boast that this is emphatically the land of self-made 
men, that here it is within the power of any one to rise as high in the 
social or political scale as his abilities will carry him.&nbsp; The 
persons to whom we refer, however, affect to despise this.&nbsp; They take 
no pride in the institutions which have been so beneficial to them, but 
look down with supreme disdain upon those who are working their way 
up.&nbsp; They are ashamed of their origin, and you cannot offend one of 
them more than to hint that you knew him a few years ago as a mechanic or a
shopkeeper.</p>
<p>Some of the &ldquo;fashionables&rdquo; appear very unexpectedly before 
the world.&nbsp; But a short while ago a family may have been living in the
humbler quarter of the city, or even in a tenement <!-- page 140--><a 
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>house.&nbsp; A sudden
fortunate speculation on the part of the husband, or father, may have 
brought them enormous wealth in the course of a few days.&nbsp; A change is
instantly made from the humble abode to a mansion on Fifth or Madison 
avenue.&nbsp; The newly acquired wealth is liberally expended in 
&ldquo;fitting up,&rdquo; and the lucky possessors of it boldly burst upon 
the world of fashion as stars of the first magnitude.&nbsp; They are 
courted by all the newly rich, and invitations to the houses of other 
&ldquo;stars&rdquo; are showered upon them.&nbsp; They may be rude, 
ignorant, uncouth in manner, but they have wealth, and that is all that is 
required.&nbsp; They are lucky indeed, if they hold their positions 
long.&nbsp; A few manage to retain the wealth which comes to them thus 
suddenly, but as a rule those who are simply lucky at the outset, find Dame
Fortune a very capricious goddess, and at the next turn of her wheel pass 
off the stage to make room for others who are soon to share the same 
fate.</p>
<p>During the oil speculations, and during the war, the shoddy class was 
largely increased by those who were made suddenly and unexpectedly rich by 
lucky ventures in petroleum lands and stocks, and by army contracts.&nbsp; 
Now other speculations provide recruits for this class, to which Wall 
street is constantly sending fresh &ldquo;stars&rdquo; to blaze awhile in 
the firmament of society, and then to make way for others.&nbsp; The shoddy
element is not, however, confined to those who acquire wealth with rapidity
or by speculations.&nbsp; There are many who rise very slowly and painfully
in the world, who, when blessed with fortune, throw themselves headlong 
into the arms of &ldquo;shoddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not difficult to recognize these persons.&nbsp; They dress not 
only handsomely, but magnificently, making up in display what they lack in 
taste.&nbsp; They cover themselves with jewels, and their diamonds, worn on
ordinary occasions, might in some instances rival the state gems of 
European sovereigns.&nbsp; Their rough, hard hands, coarse faces, loud 
voices, bad English, and vulgar manners contrast strikingly with the 
splendors with which they surround themselves.&nbsp; They wear their honors
uneasily, showing how little they are accustomed to such things.&nbsp; They
look down with disdain upon all less fortunate in wealth <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>than themselves, and 
worship as demi-gods those whose bank accounts are larger than their 
own.&nbsp; They are utterly lacking in personal dignity, and substitute for
that quality a supercilious hauteur.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; FASHIONABLE EXTRAVAGANCE.</h3>
<p>Extravagance is the besetting sin of New York society.&nbsp; Money is 
absolutely thrown away.&nbsp; Fortunes are spent every year in dress and in
all sorts of follies.&nbsp; Houses are fitted up and furnished in the most 
sumptuous style, the building and its contents being sometimes worth a 
million of dollars.&nbsp; People live up to every cent of their incomes, 
and often beyond them.&nbsp; It is no uncommon occurrence for a fine 
mansion, its furniture, pictures, and even the jewels of its occupants, to 
be pledged to some usurer for the means with which to carry on this life of
luxury.&nbsp; Each person strives to outdo his or her acquaintances.&nbsp; 
Those who have studied the matter find no slight cause for alarm in the 
rapid spread of extravagance among all classes of the city people, for the 
evil is not confined to the wealthy.&nbsp; They might afford it, but people
of moderate means, who cannot properly make such a heavy outlay, are among 
those most guilty of the fault.</p>
<p>In no other city of the land is there to be seen such magnificent 
dressing on the part of the ladies as in New York.&nbsp; The amount of 
money and time expended here on dress is amazing.&nbsp; There are two 
objects in view in all this&mdash;the best dressed woman at a ball or party
is not only sure to outshine her sisters there present, but is certain to 
have the satisfaction next day of seeing her magnificence celebrated in 
some of the city journals.&nbsp; Her vanity and love of distinction are 
both gratified in this way, and such a triumph is held to be worth any 
expense.&nbsp; There is not an evening gathering but is graced by the 
presence of ladies clad in a style of magnificence which reminds one of the
princesses in the fairy tales.&nbsp; Says a recent writer:</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
142</span>&ldquo;It is almost impossible to estimate the number of dresses 
a very fashionable woman will have.&nbsp; Most women in society can afford 
to dress as it pleases them, since they have unlimited amounts of money at 
their disposal.&nbsp; Among females dress is the principal part of 
society.&nbsp; What would Madam Mountain be without her laces and diamonds,
or Madam Blanche without her silks and satins?&nbsp; Simply commonplace old
women, past their prime, destined to be wall-flowers.&nbsp; A fashionable 
woman has just as many new dresses as the different times she goes into 
society.&nbsp; The <i>&eacute;lite</i> do not wear the same dresses 
twice.&nbsp; If you can tell us how many receptions she has in a year, how 
many weddings she attends, how many balls she participates in, how many 
dinners she gives, how many parties she goes to, how many operas and 
theatres she patronizes, we can approximate somewhat to the size and cost 
of her wardrobe.&nbsp; It is not unreasonable to suppose that she has two 
new dresses of some sort for every day in the year, or 720.&nbsp; Now to 
purchase all these, to order them made, and to put them on afterward, 
consumes a vast amount of time.&nbsp; Indeed, the woman of society does 
little but don and doff dry-goods.&nbsp; For a few brief hours she flutters
the latest tint and <i>mode</i> in the glare of the gas-light, and then 
repeats the same operation the next night.&nbsp; She must have one or two 
velvet dresses which cannot cost less than $500 each; she must possess 
thousands of dollars&rsquo; worth of laces, in the shape of flounces, to 
loop up over the skirts of dresses, as occasion shall require.&nbsp; 
Walking-dresses cost from $50 to $300; ball-dresses are frequently imported
from Paris at a cost of from $500 to a $1000; while wedding-dresses may 
cost from $1000 to $5000.&nbsp; Nice white Llama jackets can be had for 
$60; <i>robes princesse</i>, or overskirts of lace, are worth from $60 to 
$200.&nbsp; Then there are travelling-dresses in black silk, in pongee, 
velour, in piqu&eacute;, which range in price from $75 to $175.&nbsp; Then 
there are evening robes in Swiss muslin, robes in linen for the garden and 
croquet-playing, dresses for horse-races and for yacht-races, <i>robes de 
nuit</i> and <i>robes de chambre</i>, dresses for breakfast and for dinner,
dresses for receptions and for parties, dresses for watering-places, and 
dresses for all possible occasions.&nbsp; A lady going <!-- page 143--><a 
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>to the Springs takes 
from twenty to sixty dresses, and fills an enormous number of Saratoga 
trunks.&nbsp; They are of every possible fabric&mdash;from Hindoo muslin, 
&lsquo;gaze de soie,&rsquo; crape maretz, to the heavy silks of Lyons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know the wife of the editor of one of the great morning 
newspapers of New York, now travelling in Europe, whose dress-making bill 
in one year was $10,000!&nbsp; What her dry-goods bill amounted to heaven 
and her husband only know.&nbsp; She was once stopping at a summer hotel, 
and such was her anxiety to always appear in a new dress that she would 
frequently come down to dinner with a dress basted together just strong 
enough to last while she disposed of a little turtle-soup, a little 
Charlotte de Russe, and a little ice cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Judge ---, of New York, is considered one of the 
&lsquo;queens of fashion.&rsquo;&nbsp; She is a goodly-sized lady&mdash;not
quite so tall as Miss Anna Swan, of Nova Scotia&mdash;and she has the happy
faculty of piling more dry-goods upon her person than any other lady in the
city; and what is more, she keeps on doing it.&nbsp; To give the reader a 
taste of her quality, it is only necessary to describe a dress she wore at 
the Dramatic Fund Ball, not many years ago.&nbsp; There was a rich blue 
satin skirt, <i>en train</i>.&nbsp; Over this there was looped up a 
magnificent brocade silk, white, with bouquets of flowers woven in all the 
natural colors.&nbsp; This overskirt was deeply flounced with costly white 
lace, caught up with bunches of feathers of bright colors.&nbsp; About her 
shoulders was thrown a fifteen-hundred dollar shawl.&nbsp; She had a 
head-dress of white ostrich feathers, white lace, gold pendants, and purple
velvet.&nbsp; Add to all this a fan, a bouquet of rare flowers, a lace 
handkerchief, and jewelry almost beyond estimate, and you see Mrs. Judge 
--- as she appears when full blown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. General --- is a lady who goes into society a great 
deal.&nbsp; She has a new dress for every occasion.&nbsp; The following 
costume appeared at the Charity Ball, which is <i>the</i> great ball of the
year in New York.&nbsp; It was imported from Paris for the occasion, and 
was made of white satin, point lace, and a profusion of flowers.&nbsp; The 
skirt had heavy flutings of satin around the bottom, and the lace flounces 
were looped up at the sides <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>with bands of the most beautiful pinks, roses,
lilies, forget-me-nots, and other flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing uncommon to meet in New York society ladies who 
have on dry-goods and jewelry to the value of from thirty to fifty thousand
dollars.&nbsp; Dress patterns of twilled satin, the ground pale green, 
pearl, melon color, or white, scattered with sprays of flowers in raised 
velvet, sell for $300 dollars each; violet poult de soie will sell for $12 
dollars a yard; a figured moire will sell for $200 the pattern; a 
pearl-colored silk, trimmed with point appliqu&eacute; lace, sells for 
$1000; and so we might go on to an almost indefinite length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who think this an exaggerated picture have only to apply to the 
proprietor of any first-class city dry-goods store, and he will confirm its
truthfulness.&nbsp; These gentlemen will tell you that while their sales of
staple goods are heavy, they are proportionately lighter than the sales of 
articles of pure luxury.&nbsp; At Stewart&rsquo;s the average sales of 
silks, laces, velvets, shawls, gloves, furs, and embroideries is about 
$24,500 per diem.&nbsp; The sales of silks alone average about $15,000 per 
diem.</p>
<p>A few years ago the dwelling of a wealthy citizen of New York was 
consumed by fire.&nbsp; The owner of the mansion soon after applied to a 
prominent Insurance Company for the payment of the sum of $21,000, the 
amount of the risk they had taken on the wearing apparel of his daughter, a
young lady well known in society for the splendor of her attire.&nbsp; The 
company refused to pay so large a sum, and protested that the lady in 
question could not have possessed so costly a wardrobe.&nbsp; Suit was 
brought by the claimant, and, as a matter of course, an enumeration of the 
articles destroyed and their value was made to the court.&nbsp; The list 
was as follows, and is interesting as showing the mysteries of a 
fashionable lady&rsquo;s wardrobe:</p>

</table>
<p>Such lavish expenditure is a natural consequence of a state of society 
where wealth is the main distinction.&nbsp; Mrs. John Smith&rsquo;s 
position as a leader of the <i>ton</i> is due exclusively to her great 
riches and her elaborate displays.&nbsp; Mrs. Richard Roe will naturally 
try to outshine her, and thus rise above her in the social scale.&nbsp; 
Many persons seeking admission into such society, and finding wealth the 
only requisite, will make any sacrifice to accomplish their end.&nbsp; If 
they have not wealth they will affect to have it.&nbsp; They could not 
counterfeit good birth, or high breeding, but they can assume the 
appearance of being wealthy.&nbsp; They can conduct themselves, for a while
at least, in a manner utterly disproportioned to their means, and so they 
go on, until their funds and credit being exhausted, they are forced to 
drop out of the circles in which they have moved, and the so-called friends
who valued them only for their supposed wealth, instantly <!-- page 
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>forget that 
they ever knew them.&nbsp; No more invitations are left for them, they are 
not even tolerated in &ldquo;good society,&rdquo; and are &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
on the street as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Not a year passes but records the failure of some prominent business man
in New York.&nbsp; His friends are sorry for him, and admit that he was 
prudent and industrious in his business.&nbsp; &ldquo;His family did 
it,&rdquo; they tell you, shaking their heads.&nbsp; &ldquo;They lived too 
fast.&nbsp; Took too much money to run the house, to dress, and to keep up 
in society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only the All Seeing Eye can tell how many men who 
stand well in the mercantile community are tortured continually by the 
thought that their extravagance or that of their families is bringing them 
to sure and certain ruin; for not even in New York can a man live beyond 
his actual means.&nbsp; They have not the moral courage to live within 
their legitimate incomes.&nbsp; To do so would be to lose their positions 
in society, and they go on straining every nerve to meet the demands upon 
them, and then the crash comes, and they are ruined.</p>
<p>Those who dwell in the great city, and watch its ways with observant 
eyes, see many evils directly attributable to the sin of 
extravagance.&nbsp; These evils are not entirely of a pecuniary 
nature.&nbsp; There are others of a more terrible character.&nbsp; Keen 
observers see every day women whose husbands and fathers are in receipt of 
limited incomes, dressing as if their means were unlimited.&nbsp; All this 
magnificence is not purchased out of the lawful income of the husband or 
father.&nbsp; The excess is made up in other ways&mdash;often by the 
sacrifice of the woman&rsquo;s virtue.&nbsp; She finds a man willing to pay
liberally for her favors, and carries on an intrigue with him, keeping her 
confiding husband in ignorance of it all the while.&nbsp; She may have more
than one lover&mdash;perhaps a dozen.&nbsp; When a woman sins from motives 
such as these, she does not stop to count the cost.&nbsp; Her sole object 
is to get money, <i>and she gets it</i>.&nbsp; It is this class of 
nominally virtuous married and unmarried women that support the infamous 
houses of assignation to be found in the city.</p>
<p>The curse of extravagance does not manifest itself in dress alone.&nbsp;
One cannot enter the residence of a single well-to-do <!-- page 152--><a 
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>person in the city 
without seeing evidences of it.&nbsp; The house is loaded with the richest 
and rarest of articles, all intended for show, and which are oftentimes 
arranged without the least regard to taste.&nbsp; The object is to make the
house indicate as much wealth on the part of its owner as possible.&nbsp; 
It makes but little difference whether the articles are worth what was paid
for them, or whether they are arranged artistically&mdash;if the sum total 
is great, the owner is satisfied.&nbsp; It is a common thing to see the 
walls of some elegant mansion disfigured with frescoes, which, though 
executed at an enormous cost, are utterly without merit or taste.&nbsp; 
Again one sees dozens of paintings, bought for works of the old masters, 
lining the walls of the richest mansions of the city, which are the merest 
daubs, and the works of the most unscrupulous Bohemians.&nbsp; Not long 
since, a collection of paintings was offered for sale in New York, the 
owner being dead.&nbsp; They had been collected at great expense, and were 
the pride of their former owner.&nbsp; With a few exceptions they were 
wretched copies, and in the whole lot, over five hundred in number, there 
were not six genuine &ldquo;old masters,&rdquo; or &ldquo;masters&rdquo; of
any age.</p>
<p>Entertainments are given in the most costly style.&nbsp; From ten to 
twenty thousand dollars are spent in a single evening in this way.&nbsp; At
a fashionable party from twelve to fifteen hundred dollars&rsquo; worth of 
champagne is consumed, besides other wines and liquors.&nbsp; Breakfasts 
are given at a cost of from one to three thousand dollars; suppers at a 
still higher cost.&nbsp; This represents the expense to the host of the 
entertainment; but does not cover the cost of the toilettes to be provided 
for the family, which make up several thousand dollars more.</p>
<p>Suppers or dinners are favorite entertainments, and the outlay required 
for them is oftentimes very heavy.&nbsp; The host frequently provides 
nothing but viands imported from foreign lands.&nbsp; Sets of china of 
great cost, or of silver equally expensive, or even of gold, are displayed 
ostentatiously.&nbsp; Sometimes the supper-room is entirely refitted in 
red, blue, or gold, everything, even the lights and flowers, being of one 
color, in order that the affair may be known as Mrs. A---&rsquo;s red, 
blue, or gold <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>supper.&nbsp; Some of the most extravagant 
entertainers will place at the side of each cover an exquisite bouquet 
inside of which is a costly present of jewelry.</p>
<p>All this reckless expenditure in the midst of so much sorrow and 
suffering in the great city!&nbsp; &ldquo;The bitter cold of winter,&rdquo;
says the Manager of the &lsquo;Children&rsquo;s Aid Society,&rsquo; in his 
appeal for help, &ldquo;and the freezing storms have come upon thousands of
the poor children of this city, unprepared.&nbsp; They are sleeping in 
boxes, or skulking in doorways, or shivering in cellars without proper 
clothing, or shoes, and but half-fed.&nbsp; Many come bare-footed through 
the snow to our industrial schools.&nbsp; Children have been known to fall 
fainting on the floor of these schools through want of food.&nbsp; Hundreds
enter our lodging-houses every night, who have no home.&nbsp; Hundreds 
apply to our office for a place in the country, who are ragged, 
half-starved, and utterly unbefriended.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; FASHIONABLE FOLLIES.</h3>
<p>We have spoken of the women of fashion.&nbsp; What shall we say of the 
men?&nbsp; They are neither refined nor intellectual.&nbsp; They have a 
certain shrewdness coupled, perhaps, with the capacity for making 
money.&nbsp; Their conversation is coarse, ignorant, and sometimes 
indecent.&nbsp; They have not the tact which enables women to adapt 
themselves at once to their surroundings, and they enjoy their splendors 
with an awkwardness which they seek to hide beneath an air of worldly 
wisdom.&nbsp; They patronize the drama liberally, but their preference is 
for what Olive Logan calls &ldquo;the leg business.&rdquo;&nbsp; In person 
they are coarse-looking.&nbsp; Without taste of their own, they are totally
dependent upon their tailors for their &ldquo;style,&rdquo; and are nearly 
all gotten up on the same model.&nbsp; They are capital hands at staring 
ladies out of countenance, and are masters of all the arts of 
insolence.&nbsp; Society cannot make gentlemen out of them do <!-- page 
154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>what it 
will.&nbsp; As John Hibbs would say, &ldquo;they were not brought up to it 
young.&rdquo;&nbsp; They learn to love excitement, and finding even the 
reckless whirl of fashion too stale for them, seek gratification out of 
their own homes.&nbsp; They become constant visitors at the great 
gaming-houses, and are the best customers of the bagnios of the city.</p>
<p>If men have their dissipations, the women have theirs also.&nbsp; Your 
fashionable woman generally displays more tact than her husband.&nbsp; She 
has greater opportunities for display, and makes better use of them.&nbsp; 
If the ball, or party, or sociable at her residence is a success, the 
credit is hers exclusively, for the husband does little more than pay the 
bills.&nbsp; Many of these women are &ldquo;from the ranks.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
They have risen with their husbands, and are coarse and vulgar in 
appearance, and without refinement.&nbsp; But the women of fashion are not 
all vulgar or unrefined.&nbsp; Few of them are well educated, but the New 
York woman of fashion, as a rule, is not only very attractive in 
appearance, but capable of creating a decided impression upon the society 
in which she moves.&nbsp; She is thoroughly mistress of all its arts, she 
knows just when and where to exercise them to the best advantage, she 
dresses in a style the magnificence of which is indescribable, and she has 
tact enough to carry her through any situation.&nbsp; Yet, in judging her, 
one must view her as a butterfly, as a mere creature of magnificence and 
frivolity.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t seek to analyze her character as a wife or 
mother.&nbsp; You may find that the marriage vow is broken on her part as 
well as on her husband&rsquo;s; and you will most probably find that she 
has sacrificed her soul to the demands of fashion, and &ldquo;prevented the
increase of her family&rdquo; by staining her hands in the blood of her 
unborn children.&nbsp; Or, if she be guiltless of this crime, she is a 
mother in but one sense&mdash;that of bearing children.&nbsp; Fashion does 
not allow her to nurse them.&nbsp; She cannot give to her own flesh and 
blood the time demanded of her by her &ldquo;duties in society;&rdquo; so 
from their very birth the little innocents are committed to the care of 
hirelings, and they grow up without her care, removed from the ennobling 
effect of a mother&rsquo;s constant watchful presence, <!-- page 155--><a 
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>and they add to the 
number of idle, dissolute men and women of fashion, who are a curse to the 
city.</p>
<p>Your fashionable woman is all art.&nbsp; She is indeed &ldquo;fearfully 
and wonderfully made.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is a compound frequently of false 
hair, false teeth, padding of various kinds, paint, powder and 
enamel.&nbsp; Her face is &ldquo;touched up,&rdquo; or painted and lined by
a professional adorner of women, and she utterly destroys the health of her
skin by her foolish use of cosmetics.&nbsp; A prominent Broadway dealer in 
such articles sells thirteen varieties of powder for the skin, eight kinds 
of paste, and twenty-three different washes.&nbsp; Every physical defect is
skilfully remedied by &ldquo;artists;&rdquo; each of whom has his 
specialty.&nbsp; So common has the habit of resorting to these things 
become, that it is hard to say whether the average woman of fashion is a 
work of nature or a work of art.&nbsp; Men marry such women with a kind of 
&ldquo;taking the chances&rdquo; feeling, and if they get a natural woman 
think themselves lucky.</p>
<h3>IV.&nbsp; FASHIONABLE CHILDREN.</h3>
<p>As it is the custom in fashionable society in New York to prevent the 
increase of families, it is natural no doubt to try to destroy childhood in
those who are permitted to see the light.</p>
<p>The fashionable child of New York is made a miniature man or woman at 
the earliest possible period of its life.&nbsp; It does not need much 
labor, however, to develop &ldquo;Young America&rdquo; in the great 
metropolis.&nbsp; He is generally ready to go out into the world at a very 
tender age.&nbsp; Our system of society offers him every facility in his 
downward career.&nbsp; When but a child he has his own latch-key; he can 
come and go when he pleases; he attends parties, balls, dancing-school, the
theatre and other evening amusements as regularly and independently as his 
elders, and is rarely called upon by &ldquo;the Governor,&rdquo; as he 
patronizingly terms his father, to give any account of himself.&nbsp; He 
has an abundance of pocket-money, and is encouraged in the lavish <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>expenditure 
of it.&nbsp; He cultivates all the vices of his grown-up friends; and 
thinks church going a punishment and religion a bore.&nbsp; He engages in 
his dissipations with a recklessness that makes old sinners envious of his 
&ldquo;nerve.&rdquo;&nbsp; His friends are hardly such as he could 
introduce into his home.&nbsp; He is a famous &ldquo;hunter of the 
tiger,&rdquo; and laughs at his losses.&nbsp; He has a mistress, or perhaps
several; sneers at marriage, and gives it as his opinion that there is not 
a virtuous woman in the land.&nbsp; When he is fairly of age he has lost 
his freshness, and is tired of life.&nbsp; His great object now is to 
render his existence supportable.</p>
<p>Girls are forced into womanhood by fashion even more rapidly than boys 
into manhood.&nbsp; They are dressed in the most expensive manner from 
their infancy, and without much regard to their health.&nbsp; Bare arms and
necks, and short skirts are the rule, even in the bleakest weather, for 
children&rsquo;s parties, or for dancing-school, and so the tender frames 
of the little ones are subjected to an exposure that often sows the seeds 
of consumption and other disease.&nbsp; The first thing the child learns is
that it is its duty to be pretty&mdash;to look its best.&nbsp; It is taught
to value dress and show as the great necessities of existence, and is 
trained in the most extravagant habits.&nbsp; As the girl advances towards 
maidenhood, she is forced forward, and made to look as much like a woman as
possible.&nbsp; Her education is cared for after a fashion, but amounts to 
very little.&nbsp; She learns to play a little on some musical instrument, 
to sing a little, to paint a little&mdash;in short she acquires but a 
smattering of everything she undertakes.&nbsp; She is left in ignorance of 
the real duties of a woman&rsquo;s life&mdash;the higher and nobler part of
her existence.&nbsp; She marries young, and one of her own set, and her 
married life is in keeping with her girlhood.&nbsp; She is a creature in 
which nothing has been fully developed but the passions and the 
nerves.&nbsp; Her physical constitution amounts to nothing, and soon gives 
way.&nbsp; Her beauty goes with her health, and she is forced to resort to 
all manner of devices to preserve her attractions.</p>
<p>It is a habit in New York to allow children to give large <!-- page 
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
157</span>entertainments at fashionable resorts, without the restraining 
presence of their elders.&nbsp; Here crowds of boys and girls of a 
susceptible age assemble under the intoxicating influence of music, 
gas-light, full dress, late suppers, wines and liquors.&nbsp; Sometimes 
this juvenile dissipation has been carried so far that it has been sharply 
rebuked by the public press.</p>
<h3>V.&nbsp; A FASHIONABLE BELLE.</h3>
<p>An English writer gives the following clever sketch of a fashionable 
young lady of New York, whom he offers as a type of the &ldquo;Girl of the 
Period:&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to present you to Miss Flora Van Duysen Briggs.&nbsp; 
Forget Shakspeare&rsquo;s <i>dictum</i> about a name; there is a story 
attached to this name which I shall tell you by and by.&nbsp; Miss Flora is
a typical New York girl of the period; between sixteen and seventeen years 
old; a little under the medium height; hair a golden brown; eyes a violet 
blue; cheeks and lips rosy; teeth whiter and brighter than pearls; hands 
and feet extremely small and well-shaped; figure <i>petite</i> but 
exquisitely proportioned; <i>toilette</i> in the latest <i>mode de 
Paris</i>; but observe, above all, that marvellous bloom upon her face, 
which American girls share with the butterfly, the rose, the peach and the 
grape, and in which they are unequalled by any other women in the 
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Flora&rsquo;s biography is by no means singular.&nbsp; Her 
father is Ezra Briggs, Esq., a provision merchant in the city.&nbsp; 
Twenty-five years ago, Mr. Briggs came to New York from one the Eastern 
States, with a common-school education, sharp sense, and no money.&nbsp; He
borrowed a newspaper, found an advertisement for a light porter, applied 
for and obtained the situation, rose to be clerk, head-clerk, and small 
partner, and fagged along very comfortably until the Civil War broke out, 
and made his fortune.&nbsp; His firm secured a government contract, for 
which they paid dearly, and for which they made the <!-- page 158--><a 
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>Government pay 
dearer.&nbsp; Their pork was bought for a song, and sold for its weight in 
greenbacks.&nbsp; Their profits averaged 300 per cent.&nbsp; They were more
fatal to the soldiers than the bullets of the enemy.&nbsp; One consignment 
of their provisions bred a cholera at Fortress Monroe, and robbed the Union
of 15,000 brave men.&nbsp; Their enemies declared that the final defeat of 
the Southerners was owing to the capture of 1000 barrels of Briggs&rsquo;s 
mess beef by General Lee.&nbsp; But Briggs was rolling in wealth, and could
afford to smile at such taunts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flora&rsquo;s mother had been a Miss Van Duysen.&nbsp; She was a 
little, weak, useless woman, very proud of her name, which seemed to 
connect her in some way with the old Dutch aristocracy.&nbsp; In point of 
fact, Briggs married her on this account; for, like most democrats, he is 
very fond of anything aristocratic.&nbsp; Mrs. Briggs, <i>n&eacute;e</i> 
Van Duysen, has nothing Dutch about her but her name.&nbsp; The 
Knickerbockers of New York were famous for their thrift, their economy, 
their neatness, and, above all, their housewifely virtues.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Briggs is thriftless, extravagant, dowdy in her old age, although she had 
been a beauty in her youth, and knows as little about keeping a house as 
she does about keeping a horse.&nbsp; During the war, at a fair given for 
the benefit of the Sanitary Commission, in Union Square, several 
Knickerbocker ladies organized a kitchen upon the old Dutch model, and 
presided there in the costumes of their grandmothers.&nbsp; Mrs. Briggs was
placed upon the committee of management, but declined to serve, on account 
of the unbecoming costume she was invited to wear, and because she 
considered it unladylike to sit in a kitchen.&nbsp; But Mrs. Briggs 
preserved her caste, and benefited the Sanitary Commission much more than 
she would have done by her presence, by sending a cheque for $500 
instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we linger too long upon these family matters?&nbsp; No; to 
appreciate Miss Flora, you must understand her surroundings.&nbsp; She has 
never had a home.&nbsp; Born in a boarding-house, when her parents were not
rich, she lives at a hotel now that her father is a millionaire.&nbsp; Mr. 
Briggs married the name of Van Duysen, in order to get into society.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
159</span>Miss Van Duysen married Briggs&rsquo;s money, in order to spend 
it.&nbsp; Miss Flora Van Duysen Briggs combines her mother&rsquo;s name and
her father&rsquo;s money; her Mother&rsquo;s early beauty and her 
father&rsquo;s shrewdness; her mother&rsquo;s extravagance and her 
father&rsquo;s weakness for the aristocracy.&nbsp; She has good taste, as 
her <i>toilette</i> shows; but she does not believe that anything can be 
tasteful that is not expensive.&nbsp; Her aim is to run ahead of the 
fashions, instead of following them; but she is clever enough to so adapt 
them to her face and figure, that she always looks well-dressed, and yet 
always attracts attention.&nbsp; Her little handsome head is full of native
wit, and of nothing else.&nbsp; Her education has been shamefully 
neglected.&nbsp; She has had the best masters, who have taught her 
nothing.&nbsp; Like all other American girls, she plays on the piano, but 
does not play the piano&mdash;you will please notice this subtle but 
suggestive distinction.&nbsp; She has picked up a smattering of French, 
partly because it is a fashionable accomplishment, and partly because she 
intends to marry; but I will not yet break your heart by announcing her 
matrimonial intentions.&nbsp; Compared with an English or French girl of 
the same age, she has many and grave deficiencies; but she atones for them 
by a wonderful tact and cleverness, which blind you to all her faults and 
lend a new grace to all her virtues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth to say, the admirers of Miss Flora, whose name is Legion, 
give her the credit for all her own virtues, and blame her father and 
mother, and the system, for all her faults.&nbsp; Born, as we have said, in
a boarding-house, left entirely in charge of the nurse-maid, educated at a 
fashionable day-school, brought into society before fifteen, living in the 
whirl, the bustle, the luxury, and the unhomeliness of a hotel, what could 
you expect of Miss Flora but that she should be, at seventeen years of age,
a butterfly in her habits, a clever dunce as regards solid knowledge, and a
premature woman of the world in her tastes and manners?&nbsp; The 
apartments which the Briggs family occupy at the Fifth Avenue Hotel are 
magnificently decorated and furnished, but they do not constitute a 
home.&nbsp; Several times Mr. Briggs has offered to purchase a house in a 
fashionable thoroughfare; but his wife objects to the trouble of managing 
unruly <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
160</span>servants, and terrifies Mr. Briggs out of the notion by stories 
of burglars admitted, and plate stolen, and families murdered in their 
beds, through the connivance of the domestics.&nbsp; What more can any one 
desire than the Briggs family obtain at the hotel for a fixed sum per week,
and a liberal margin for extras?&nbsp; The apartments are ample and 
comfortable; the <i>cuisine</i> and the wines are irreproachable; there is 
a small table reserved for them, to which they can invite whom they choose;
an immense staff of servants obey their slightest wish; their carriages, 
kept at a neighboring livery stable, can be sent for at any moment; they 
are as secluded in their own rooms as if they lived in another street, so 
far as the family in the next <i>suite</i> is concerned; they are certain 
to meet everybody, and can choose their own company; the spacious hotel 
parlors are at their disposal whenever they wish to give an evening party, 
reception, or <i>th&eacute; dansant</i>.&nbsp; What more could they gain by
setting up a private house?&nbsp; Mr. Briggs, having never tried the 
experiment, does not know.&nbsp; Mrs. Briggs, whose only reminiscence of a 
private residence is the one in which her mother let lodgings, does not 
know.&nbsp; Miss Flora Van Duysen Briggs, having never been used to any 
other way of life than the present, neither knows nor cares, and 
&lsquo;does not want to be bothered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Briggs family spend their winters in town, their summers at 
Newport, Saratoga, or some other watering-place, at which nobody cares 
anything about the water.&nbsp; The frequenters of these rural or seaside 
retreats are presumed to come for their health, but really come to show 
their dresses.&nbsp; Thus Miss Flora&rsquo;s life varies very little all 
the year round; she rises late, and is dressed for breakfast; after 
breakfast she practises upon the piano, shops with her mamma, and returns 
to be dressed for luncheon; after luncheon she usually takes a brief nap, 
or lies down to read a novel, and is then dressed for the afternoon 
promenade, as you have just seen her; after the promenade she is dressed 
for a drive with mamma in the Central Park; after the drive she is dressed 
for dinner, or dines in her out-of-door costume, preparatory to being 
dressed for the opera, the theatre, a ball, or a party.&nbsp; Every Tuesday
she receives calls; every <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Thursday she calls upon her 
acquaintances.&nbsp; Whenever she has a spare moment, it is bestowed upon 
her dressmaker.&nbsp; If she thinks, it is to design new trimmings; if she 
dreams, it is of a heavenly <i>soir&eacute;e dansante</i>, with an eternal 
waltz to everlasting music, and a tireless partner in paradisiacal 
Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As all the best and&mdash;in a double sense&mdash;the dearest 
things of Miss Flora&rsquo;s life come from Paris, it is quite natural that
she should look to Paris for her future.&nbsp; The best of all authorities 
declares that &lsquo;where the treasure is there will the heart be 
also.&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Flora&rsquo;s treasures are in the Parisian 
<i>magasins</i>, and her heart is with them.&nbsp; Although scores of young
men kneel at her feet, press her hands, and deride the stars in comparison 
with her eyes, she cares for none of her worshippers.&nbsp; She smiles upon
them, but the smile is no deeper than the lips; she flirts with them, but 
stops at that sharp, invisible line which separates a flirtation from a 
compromising earnestness; she is a coquette, but not a jilt.&nbsp; If she 
encourages all, it is because she prefers none.&nbsp; Her heart has never 
been touched, and she knows that none of her admirers in her own country 
can hope to touch it.&nbsp; Her rivals scornfully assert that she has no 
heart; but as she is, after all, a woman, this assertion must be 
incorrect.&nbsp; She is in love with an ideal, but that ideal has a 
title.&nbsp; So soon as Mr. Briggs can dispose of his business, Miss Flora 
is to be taken to Paris.&nbsp; Within two years afterwards she will be led 
to the altar by a French duke, marquis, or count, who will fall in love 
with her father&rsquo;s bank-book, and then she will figure as an ornament 
of the French Court, or the <i>salons</i> of the Faubourg 
Saint-Germain.&nbsp; This is her ambition, and she will certainly 
accomplish it.&nbsp; The blood of the Van Duysens and the money of Briggs 
can accomplish anything when united in Miss Flora.&nbsp; With this end in 
view, the little lady is as inaccessible to ordinary admirers as a 
princess.&nbsp; She is a duchess by anticipation, and feels the pride of 
station in advance.&nbsp; There is no danger that she will falter in the 
race through any womanly weakness, nor through any lack of knowledge of the
wiles of men.&nbsp; With the beauty of Venus and the chastity of Diana, she
also possesses qualities derived directly from Mother Eve.&nbsp; An English
<!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
162</span>matron would blush to know, and a French <i>m&egrave;re</i> would
be astonished to learn, secrets which Miss Flora has at her pretty 
finger-ends.&nbsp; She has acquired her knowledge innocently, and she will 
use it judiciously.&nbsp; Nothing escapes her quick eyes and keen ears, and
under that demure forehead is a faculty which enables her to &lsquo;put 
this and that together,&rsquo; and arrive at conclusions which would amaze 
her less acute foreign sisters.&nbsp; You may not envy her this faculty, 
but do not accuse her of employing it improperly.&nbsp; She will never 
disgrace herself nor the coronet which she already feels pressing lightly 
upon her head.&nbsp; As she trips out of sight, it may give any man a 
heart-pang to think that there is at least one lovely woman who is 
impenetrable to love; but then, if she were like those dear, soft, fond, 
impressible, confiding beauties of a former age, she would not be 
herself&mdash;a Girl of the Period.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>VI.&nbsp; FASHIONABLE ENTERTAINMENTS.</h3>
<p>New York has long been celebrated for its magnificent social 
entertainments.&nbsp; Its balls, dinner parties, receptions, private 
theatricals, pic-nics, croquet parties, and similar gatherings are 
unsurpassed in respect to show in any city in the world.&nbsp; Every year 
some new species of entertainment is devised by some leader in society, and
repeated throughout the season by every one who can raise the money to pay 
for it.&nbsp; The variety, however, is chiefly in the name, for all 
parties, breakfasts, dinners, suppers, or receptions are alike.</p>
<p>Of late years it is becoming common not to give entertainments at 
one&rsquo;s residence, but to hire public rooms set apart for that 
purpose.&nbsp; There is a large house in the upper part of Fifth avenue, 
which is fitted up exclusively for the use of persons giving balls, 
suppers, or receptions.&nbsp; It is so large that several entertainments 
can be held at the same time on its different floors, without either 
annoying or inconveniencing the others.&nbsp; <!-- page 163--><a 
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>The proprietor of the
establishment provides everything down to the minutest detail, the wishes 
and tastes of the giver of the entertainment being scrupulously respected 
in everything.&nbsp; The host and hostess, in consequence, have no trouble,
but have simply to be on hand at the proper time to receive their 
guests.&nbsp; This is a very expensive mode of entertaining, and costs from
5000 to 15,000 dollars, for the caterer expects a liberal profit on 
everything he provides; but to those who can afford it, it is a very 
sensible plan.&nbsp; It saves an immense amount of trouble at home, and 
preserves one&rsquo;s carpets and furniture from the damage invariably done
to them on such occasions, and averts all possibility of robbery by the 
strange servants one is forced to employ.&nbsp; Still, many who possess 
large and elegant mansions of their own prefer to entertain at their own 
homes.</p>
<p>On such occasions, the lady giving the entertainment issues her 
invitations, and usually summons the famous Brown, the Sexton of Grace 
Church, to assist her in deciding who shall be asked beyond her immediate 
circle of friends.&nbsp; Mr. Brown is a very tyrant in such matters, and 
makes out the list to suit himself rather than to please the hostess.&nbsp;
He has full authority from her to invite any distinguished strangers who 
may be in the city.</p>
<p>Upon the evening appointed a carpet is spread from the curbstone to the 
front door, and over this is placed a temporary awning.&nbsp; A policeman 
is engaged to keep off the crowd and regulate the movements of the 
carriages.&nbsp; About nine o&rsquo;clock magnificent equipages, with 
drivers and footmen in livery, commence to arrive, and from these gorgeous 
vehicles richly dressed ladies and gentlemen alight, and pass up the 
carpeted steps to the entrance door.&nbsp; On such occasions gentlemen are 
excluded from the carriage if possible, as all the space within the vehicle
is needed for the lady&rsquo;s skirts.&nbsp; The lady is accompanied by a 
maid whose business it is to adjust her <i>toilette</i> in the dressing 
room, and see that everything is in its proper place.</p>
<p>At the door stands some one, generally the inevitable Brown, to receive 
the cards of invitation.&nbsp; Once admitted, the ladies and gentlemen pass
into the dressing rooms set apart for them.&nbsp; <!-- page 164--><a 
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>Here they put the 
last touches to their dress and hair, and, the ladies having joined their 
escorts, enter the drawing room and pay their respects to the host and 
hostess.&nbsp; When from one to two thousand guests are to be received, the
reader may imagine that the labors of the host and hostess are not 
slight.</p>
<p>Every arrangement is made for dancing.&nbsp; A fine orchestra is 
provided, and is placed so that it may consume as little space as 
possible.&nbsp; A row of chairs placed around the room, and tied in couples
with pocket-handkerchiefs, denotes that &ldquo;The German&rdquo; is to be 
danced during the course of the evening.&nbsp; There is very little 
dancing, however, of any kind, before midnight, the intervening time being 
taken up with the arrivals of guests and promenading.</p>
<p>About midnight the supper room is thrown open, and there is a rush for 
the tables, which are loaded with every delicacy that money can buy.&nbsp; 
The New York physicians ought to be devoutly thankful for these 
suppers.&nbsp; They bring them many a fee.&nbsp; The servants are all 
French, and are clad in black swallow-tail coats and pants, with immaculate
white vests, cravats and gloves.&nbsp; They are as active as a set of 
monkeys, and are capital hands at anticipating your wants.&nbsp; Sometimes 
the refreshments are served in the parlors, and are handed to the guests by
the servants.</p>
<p>The richest and costliest of wines flow freely.&nbsp; At a certain 
entertainment given not long since, 500 bottles of champagne, worth over 
four dollars each, were drunk.&nbsp; Some young men make a habit of 
abstaining carefully during the day, in order to be the better prepared to 
drink at night.&nbsp; The ladies drink almost as heavily as the men, and 
some of them could easily drink their partners under the table.</p>
<p>After supper the dancing begins in earnest.&nbsp; If The German is 
danced it generally consumes the greater part of the evening.&nbsp; I shall
not undertake to describe it here.&nbsp; It is a great mystery, and those 
who understand it appear to have exhausted in mastering it their capacity 
for understanding anything else.&nbsp; It is a dance in which the greatest 
freedom is permitted, and in which liberties are taken and encouraged, 
which would be <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>resented under other circumstances.&nbsp; The 
figures really depend upon the leader of the dance, who can set such as he 
chooses, or devise them, if he has wit enough.&nbsp; All the rest are 
compelled to follow his example.&nbsp; The dance is thoroughly suited to 
the society <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
166</span>we are considering, and owes its popularity to the liberties, to 
use no stronger term, it permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p165.jpg">
<img alt="THE GERMAN" src="images/p165.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The <i>toilettes</i> of the persons present are magnificent.&nbsp; The 
ladies are very queens in their gorgeousness.&nbsp; They make their trails 
so long that half the men are in mortal dread of breaking their necks over 
them; and having gone to such expense for dry goods in this quarter, they 
display the greatest economy about the neck and bust.&nbsp; They may be in 
&ldquo;full dress&rdquo; as to the lower parts of their bodies, but they 
are fearfully undressed from the head to the waist.</p>
<p>Towards morning the ball breaks up.&nbsp; The guests, worn out with 
fatigue, and not unfrequently confused with liquor, take leave of their 
hosts and go home.&nbsp; Many of them repeat the same performance almost 
nightly during the season.&nbsp; No wonder that when the summer comes they 
are so much in need of recuperation.</p>
<h3>VII.&nbsp; MARRIAGE AND DEATH.</h3>
<p>Only wealthy marriages are tolerated in New York society.&nbsp; For men 
or women to marry beneath them is a crime society cannot forgive.&nbsp; 
There must be fortune on one side at least.&nbsp; Marriages for money are 
directly encouraged.&nbsp; It is not uncommon for a man who has won a 
fortune to make the marriage of his daughter the means of getting his 
family into society.&nbsp; He will go to some young man within the pale of 
good society, and offer him the hand of his daughter and a fortune.&nbsp; 
The condition demanded of the aforesaid young man is that he shall do what 
may lie within his power to get the family of the bride within the charmed 
circle.&nbsp; If the girl is good looking, or agreeable, the offer is 
rarely refused.</p>
<p>When a marriage is decided upon, the engagement is announced through one
of the &ldquo;society newspapers,&rdquo; of which there are several.&nbsp; 
It is the bounden duty of the happy pair to be married in a fashionable 
church.&nbsp; To be married in or buried from <!-- page 167--><a 
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Grace or St. 
Thomas&rsquo;s Church, is the desire of every fashionable heart.&nbsp; 
Invitations are issued to the friends of the two families, and no one is 
admitted into the church without a card.&nbsp; Often &ldquo;no cards&rdquo;
are issued, and the church is jammed by the outside throng, who profane the
holy temple by their unmannerly struggles to secure places from which to 
view the ceremony.&nbsp; Two clergymen are usually engaged to tie the knot,
in order that a Divorce Court may find it the easier to undo.&nbsp; A 
reporter is on hand, who furnishes the city papers with a full description 
of the grand affair.&nbsp; The dresses, the jewels, the appearance of the 
bride and groom, and the company generally, are described with all the 
eloquence Jenkins is master of.</p>
<p>If the wedding be at Grace Church, Brown, &ldquo;the great sexton&rdquo;
is in charge.&nbsp; A wedding over which he presides is sure to be a great 
success.&nbsp; A wonderful man is Brown.&nbsp; No account of New York 
society would be complete without a few words about Brown.&nbsp; He has 
been sexton of Grace Church ever since the oldest inhabitant can remember, 
and those familiar with the matter are sorely puzzled to know what the 
church will do when Brown is gathered to his fathers.&nbsp; The 
congregation would sooner part with the best Rector they have ever had than
give up Brown.&nbsp; A certain Rector did once try to compel him to resign 
his post because he, the Rector, did not fancy Brown&rsquo;s ways, which he
said were hardly consistent with the reverence due the house of God.&nbsp; 
The congregation, however, were aghast at the prospect of losing Brown, and
plainly gave the Rector to understand that he must not interfere with the 
sexton.&nbsp; Never mind about his want of reverence.&nbsp; The 
Rector&rsquo;s business was to look after the religious part of the 
congregation, while Brown superintended the secular affairs of that 
fashionable corporation.&nbsp; They had use for the Rector only on Sunday; 
but Brown they looked up to every day in the week.&nbsp; The Rector meekly 
subsided, and Brown forgave him.</p>
<p>A very lucky man is Brown, and very far from being a fool.&nbsp; There 
is no sharper, shrewder man in New York, and no one who estimates his 
customers more correctly.&nbsp; He puts a high price on his services, and 
is said to have accumulated a <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>handsome fortune, popularly estimated at about
$300,000.&nbsp; Fat and sleek, and smooth of tongue, he can be a very 
despot when he chooses.&nbsp; He keeps a list of the fashionable young men 
of the city, who find it to their interest to be on good terms with him, 
since they are mainly dependent upon him for their invitations.&nbsp; 
Report says that, like a certain great statesman, Brown is not averse to 
receiving a small present now and then as a reminder of the gratitude of 
the recipients of his favors.</p>
<p>Brown is sixty years old, but time has dealt lightly with him, and he is
still hale and hearty.&nbsp; He knows all the gossip of New York for thirty
years back, but also knows how to hold his tongue.&nbsp; To see him in his 
glory, one should wait until the breaking up of some great party.&nbsp; 
Then he takes his stand on the steps of the mansion, and in the most 
pompous manner calls the carriages of the guests.&nbsp; There is no chance 
for sleep in the neighborhood when the great voice of the &ldquo;great 
sexton&rdquo; is roaring down the avenue.&nbsp; He takes care that the 
whole neighborhood shall know who have honored the entertainment with their
presence.</p>
<p>He has a sharp tongue, too, this Brown, when he chooses to use it, and a
good story is told of this quality of his.&nbsp; He was once calling the 
carriages at a brilliant party.&nbsp; Among the guests was Harry X---, a 
young gentleman of fortune, concerning whose morals some hard things were 
said.&nbsp; It was hinted that Mr. X--- was rather too fond of faro.&nbsp; 
The young gentleman and the great sexton were not on good terms, and when 
Brown, having summoned Mr. X---&rsquo;s carriage, asked, as usual, 
&ldquo;Where to, sir?&rdquo; he received the short and sharp reply, 
&ldquo;To where he brought me from.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right, 
sir,&rdquo; said Brown, calmly, and turning to the driver he exclaimed in a
loud tone, &ldquo;Drive Mr. X--- to John Chamberlain&rsquo;s 
faro-bank.&rdquo;&nbsp; A roar of laughter greeted this sally, and Brown 
smiled serenely as his discomfited enemy was driven away.</p>
<p>Fashionable weddings are very costly affairs.&nbsp; The outfits of the 
bride and groom cost thousands of dollars, the extravagance of the man 
being fully equal to that of his bride.&nbsp; A wedding is attended with 
numerous entertainments, all of which <!-- page 169--><a 
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>are costly, and the 
expenses attendant upon the affair itself are enormous.&nbsp; The outlay is
not confined to the parties immediately concerned, the friends of the happy
pair must go to great expense to give to the bride elegant and appropriate 
presents.&nbsp; One, two, or three rooms, as may be required, are set apart
at every fashionable wedding, for the display of the presents.&nbsp; These 
are visited and commented upon by the friends of the bride and groom, such 
being the prescribed custom.&nbsp; The presents are frequently worth a 
handsome fortune.&nbsp; At the marriage of the daughter of a notorious 
politician not long since, the wedding presents were valued at more than 
$250,000.&nbsp; Efforts have been repeatedly made to put a stop to the 
giving of such costly presents, but the custom still continues.</p>
<p>As it is the ambition of every one of the class we are discussing to 
live fashionably, so it is their chief wish to be laid in the grave in the 
same style.&nbsp; The undertaker at a fashionable funeral is generally the 
sexton of some fashionable church, perhaps of the church the deceased was 
in the habit of attending.&nbsp; This individual prescribes the manner in 
which the funeral ceremonies shall be conducted, and advises certain styles
of mourning for the family.&nbsp; Sometimes the blinds of the house are 
closed, and the gas lighted in the hall and parlors.&nbsp; The lights in 
such cases are arranged in the most artistic manner, and everything is made
to look as &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; as possible.</p>
<p>A certain fashionable sexton always refuses to allow the female members 
of the family to follow their dead to the grave.&nbsp; He will not let them
be seen at the funeral, at all, as he says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horribly 
vulgar to see a lot of women crying about a corpse; and, besides, 
they&rsquo;re always in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The funeral over, the bereaved ones must remain in the house for a 
certain length of time, the period being regulated by a set decree.&nbsp; 
To be seen on the street within the prescribed time, would be to lose 
caste.&nbsp; Many of the days of their seclusion are passed in 
consultations with their <i>modiste</i>, in preparing the most fashionable 
mourning that can be thought of.&nbsp; They no doubt agree fully with a 
certain famous <i>modiste</i> of the city, <!-- page 170--><a 
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>who once declared to 
a widow, but recently bereaved, that &ldquo;fashionable and becoming 
mourning is <i>so comforting</i> to persons in affliction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, after all, only the rich can afford to die and be buried in style 
in the great city.&nbsp; A lot in Greenwood is worth more than many 
comfortable dwellings in Brooklyn.&nbsp; A fashionable funeral entails 
heavy expenses upon the family of the deceased.&nbsp; The coffin must be of
rosewood, or some other costly material, and must be lined with 
satin.&nbsp; A profusion of white flowers must be had to cover it and to 
deck the room in which the corpse is laid out.&nbsp; The body must be 
dressed in a suit of the latest style and finest quality, and the cost of 
the hearse and carriages, the expenses at the church and cemetery, and the 
fees of the undertaker, are very heavy.&nbsp; The average expense of such 
an occasion may be set down at from $1500 to $2000.</p>
<h3><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
171</span>VII.&nbsp; THE MUNICIPAL POLICE.</h3>
<p>Until the passage of the new Charter in 1870, the Police Department was 
independent of the control of the city officials, and consequently 
independent of local political influences.&nbsp; There was a 
&ldquo;Metropolitan Police District,&rdquo; embracing the cities of New 
York and Brooklyn, and the counties of New York, Kings, Richmond and 
Westchester, and a part of Queen&rsquo;s county, in all a circuit of about 
thirty miles.&nbsp; The control of this district was committed to a 
commission of five citizens, who were subject to the supervision of the 
Legislature of the State.&nbsp; The Mayors of New York and Brooklyn were 
ex-officio members of this board.</p>
<p>The Charter of 1870 changed all this.&nbsp; It broke up the Metropolitan
District, and placed the police of New York and Brooklyn under the control 
of their respective municipal governments.&nbsp; To the credit of the force
be it said, the police of New York were less under the influence of the 
Ring than any other portion of the municipality, and improved rather than 
depreciated in efficiency.</p>
<p>As at present constituted, the force is under the control and 
supervision of four Commissioners appointed by the Mayor.&nbsp; The force 
consists of a Superintendent, four Inspectors, thirty-two Captains, one 
hundred and twenty-eight Sergeants, sixty-four Roundsmen and 2085 
Patrolmen, Detectives, Doorkeepers, etc.</p>
<p>The present Superintendent of Police is Mr. James J. Kelso.&nbsp; He is 
the Commander-in-chief of the force, and it is through him that all orders 
are issued.&nbsp; His subordinates are responsible to him for the proper 
discharge of their duties, and he in his turn to the Commissioners.&nbsp; 
He was promoted to his present <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>position on the death of Superintendent 
Jourdan, and has rendered himself popular with men of all parties by his 
conscientious discharge of his important duties.&nbsp; Mr. Kelso is 
eminently fitted for his position.&nbsp; His long service in the force, and
great experience as a detective officer, have thoroughly familiarized him 
with the criminals with whom he has to deal, and the crimes against which 
he has to contend.&nbsp; He has maintained the discipline of the force at a
high point, and has been rigorous in dealing with the offenders against the
law.&nbsp; His sudden and sweeping descents upon the gambling hells, and 
other disreputable places of the city, have stricken terror to the 
frequenters thereof.&nbsp; They are constantly alarmed, for they know not 
at what moment they may be captured by Kelso in one of his characteristic 
raids.</p>
<p>In person Mr. Kelso is a fine-looking, and rather handsome man.&nbsp; He
shows well at the head of the force.&nbsp; It is said that he was 
overwhelmed with mortification last July, when the Mayor compelled him to 
forbid the &ldquo;Orange Parade,&rdquo; and thus make a cowardly surrender 
to the mob.&nbsp; When Governor Hoffman revoked Mayor Hall&rsquo;s order, 
at the demand of the indignant citizens, Kelso was perhaps the happiest man
in New York.&nbsp; He had a chance to vindicate his own manhood and the 
honor of the force, and he and his men did nobly on that memorable day.</p>
<p>The city is divided into two Inspection Districts, each of which is in 
charge of two Inspectors.&nbsp; Each Inspector is held responsible for the 
general good conduct and order of his District.&nbsp; It is expected that 
he will visit portions of it at uncertain hours of the night, in order that
the Patrolmen may be made more vigilant by their ignorance of the hour of 
his appearance on their &ldquo;beats.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Inspectors keep a 
constant watch over the rank and file of the force.&nbsp; They examine the 
Police Stations, and everything connected with them, at pleasure, and 
receive and investigate complaints made by citizens against members of the 
force.&nbsp; The creation of this useful grade is due to John A. Kennedy, 
the first Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p><!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
173</span>The Inspection Districts are sub-divided into thirty-two 
precincts, in each of which there is a Police Station.&nbsp; Each Station 
is in charge of a Captain, who is held to a strict accountability for the 
preservation of the peace and good order of his precinct.&nbsp; He has 
authority to post the men under his command in such parts of his precinct, 
and to assign them to such duties as he deems expedient, under the 
supervision of the Superintendent.&nbsp; He is required to divide his force
into two equal parts, called the First and Second Platoons.&nbsp; Each 
Platoon consists of two Sections.&nbsp; Each of the four Sections is in 
charge of a Sergeant.</p>
<p>In the illness or absence of the Captain, the Station and Precinct are 
commanded by one of the Sergeants, who is named for that purpose by the 
Superintendent.&nbsp; The special duties of the Sergeants are to patrol 
their precincts, and see that the Roundsmen and Patrolmen are at their 
posts and performing their duties properly.&nbsp; They are severally 
responsible for the condition of their Sections.&nbsp; One of the Sergeants
is required to remain at the Station House at all times.</p>
<p>Two Roundsmen are selected by the Commissioners from the Patrolmen of 
each precinct, and one of them is assigned to each platoon.&nbsp; They have
the immediate supervision of the Patrolmen, and are required to exercise a 
vigilant watch over them at all times.</p>
<p>The Patrolmen are the privates of the force.&nbsp; They are assigned 
certain &ldquo;beats&rdquo; or districts to watch.&nbsp; Many of these 
beats are too large for the care of one man, and more is expected of the 
Patrolman than he is capable of performing.&nbsp; He is required to 
exercise the utmost vigilance to prevent the occurrence of any crime within
his beat, and to render the commission of it difficult, at the least.&nbsp;
The occurrence of a crime on the streets is always regarded as presumptive 
evidence of negligence on his part, and he is obliged to show that he was 
strictly attending to his duties at the time.&nbsp; He is required to watch
vigilantly every person passing him while on duty, to examine frequently 
the doors, lower windows, and gates of the houses on his beat, and warn the
occupants if any are open or <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>unlocked; to have a general knowledge of the 
persons residing in his beat; to report to his commanding officer 
&ldquo;all persons known or suspected of being policy dealers, gamblers, 
receivers of stolen property, thieves, burglars, or offenders of any 
kind;&rdquo; to watch all disorderly houses or houses of ill-fame, and 
observe &ldquo;and report to his commanding officer <i>all persons by whom 
they are frequented</i>;&rdquo; to do certain other things for the 
preservation of the public peace; and to arrest for certain offences, all 
of which are laid down in the volume of Regulations, of which each member 
of the force is obliged to have a copy.&nbsp; Patrolmen are not allowed to 
converse with each other, except to ask or impart information, upon meeting
at the confines of their posts; &ldquo;and they must not engage in 
conversation with any person on any part of their post, except in regard to
matters concerning the immediate discharge of their duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The uniform of the force is a frock coat and pants of dark blue navy 
cloth, and a glazed cap.&nbsp; In the summer the dress is a sack and pants 
of dark blue navy flannel.&nbsp; The officers are distinguished by 
appropriate badges.&nbsp; Each member of the force is provided with a 
shield of a peculiar pattern, on which is his number.&nbsp; This is his 
badge of office, and he is obliged to show it when required.&nbsp; The men 
are armed with batons or short clubs of hard wood, and revolvers.&nbsp; The
latter they are forbidden to use except in grave emergencies.</p>
<p>The general misdemeanors of which the police are bound to take notice, 
are: Attempts to pick a pocket, especially where the thief is a known 
pickpocket; cruel usage of animals in public places; interfering with the 
telegraph wires; selling or carrying a slingshot; aiding in any way in a 
prize fight, dog fight, or cock fight; destroying fences, trees, or lamps, 
or defacing property; aiding in theatrical entertainments on Sunday; 
disorderly conduct; participating in or inciting to riots; assaults; 
drunkenness on the streets; gambling; discharging fire-arms on the streets;
and other stated offences.&nbsp; The officer must be careful to arrest the 
true offender, and not to interfere with any innocent person, and is 
forbidden to use violence unless the resistance of his prisoner is such as 
to render violence <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>absolutely necessary, and even then he is held
responsible for the particular degree of force exerted.&nbsp; If he is 
himself unable to make the arrest, or if he has good reason to fear an 
attempt at a rescue of the prisoner, it is his duty to call upon the 
bystanders for assistance; and any person who refuses him when so called 
on, is guilty of a misdemeanor, for which he may be arrested and 
punished.</p>
<p>Promotions are made in the force as follows: Inspectors are chosen from 
the Captains, Captains from Sergeants, Sergeants from Roundsmen, and 
Roundsmen from the most efficient Patrolmen.</p>
<p>The duties of a policeman are hard, and the salaries are moderate in 
every grade.&nbsp; The hours for duty of the Patrolmen are divided in the 
following manner: from six to eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning; from 
eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning to one in the afternoon; from one in the
afternoon to six; from six to twelve midnight; from twelve midnight to six 
in the morning.&nbsp; These &ldquo;tours&rdquo; of duty are so distributed 
that no one man shall be called on duty at the same hour on two successive 
days.&nbsp; One-third of the entire force, about 700 in all, is on duty in 
the daytime, and two-thirds, about 1400 men, at night.&nbsp; Sickness and 
casualties bring down this estimate somewhat, but the men are such fine 
physical specimens that sick leaves are now comparatively rare.</p>
<p>Besides the Patrolmen there are several divisions of the force.&nbsp; 
Forty men, called the Court Squad, are on duty at the various Courts of 
Justice.&nbsp; Four have charge of the House of Detention for Witnesses, 
No. 203 Mulberry street.&nbsp; The Sanitary Squad consists of a captain, 
four sergeants, and fifty-seven patrolmen.&nbsp; Some of these are on duty 
at the ferries and steamboat landings.&nbsp; Others are detailed to examine
the steam boilers in use in the city.&nbsp; Others execute the orders of 
the Board of Health.&nbsp; Another detachment, nine in number, look after 
truant children.&nbsp; Others are detailed for duty at banks and other 
places.&nbsp; The Detectives will be referred to hereafter.</p>

<p>The qualifications demanded of an applicant for admission into the force
are thus set down in the book of Regulations: <!-- page 177--><a 
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>&ldquo;No person will
be appointed a Patrolman of the Metropolitan Police Force unless, he</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, is able to read and write the English language 
understandingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second, is a citizen of the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third, has been a resident of this State for a term of one year 
next prior to his application for the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourth, has never been convicted of a crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifth, is at least five feet eight inches in height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixth, is less than thirty-five years of age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventh, is in good health, and of sound body and mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighth, is of good moral character and habits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Applicants for the office must present to the Board of 
Commissioners a petition signed by not less than five citizens of good 
character and habits, and verified by the affidavit of one of 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As none but &ldquo;sound&rdquo; men are wanted, the applicant is then 
subjected to a rigid medical examination; and the writer is informed by one
of the most efficient surgeons of the force, that scarcely one applicant in
ten can stand this test.&nbsp; The applicant must also give, under oath, an
exact statement as to his parentage, nationality, education, personal 
condition in every respect, business or employment, and physical 
condition.</p>
<p>The strictest discipline is maintained in the force, and offences are 
rigidly reported and punished.&nbsp; All members are required at once to 
communicate intelligence of importance to their superior officers.&nbsp; 
The men are regularly drilled in military exercises, to fit them for 
dealing efficiently with serious disturbances.&nbsp; The writer can 
testify, that during their parade in the Spring of 1871, they presented as 
fine an appearance, and executed their man&oelig;uvres as correctly as any 
body of regular troops.</p>
<p>The finest looking and largest men are detailed for service on 
Broadway.&nbsp; One of their principal duties is to keep the street free 
from obstructions, no slight task when one considers the usual jam in the 
great thoroughfare.&nbsp; It is a common habit to denounce the 
&ldquo;Broadway Squad&rdquo; as more ornamental <!-- page 178--><a 
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>than useful, but the 
habitu&eacute;s of that street can testify to the arduous labor performed 
by the &ldquo;giants,&rdquo; and the amount of protection afforded by them 
to the merchants and promenaders.&nbsp; Scarcely a day passes that they do 
not prevent robberies and cut short the operations of pickpockets.</p>
<p>The number of arrests made by the force is fair evidence of their 
efficiency.&nbsp; Since 1862 the annual number has been as follows:</p>

<p>During the past nine years over 73,000 lost children have been restored 
to their parents by the police.&nbsp; More than 40,000 houses have been 
found open at night, owing to the carelessness of the inmates, who have 
been warned of their danger by the police in time to prevent robbery.&nbsp;
There is scarcely a fire but is marked by the individual heroism of some 
member of the force, and the daily papers abound in instances of rescues 
from <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
179</span>drowning by the policemen stationed along the docks.&nbsp; In 
times of riot and other public danger, the police force have never been 
found lacking, and they have fairly won the &ldquo;flag of honor&rdquo; 
which the citizens of New York are about to present to them in recognition 
of their gallant and efficient services on the 12th of July, 1871.&nbsp; 
That there are individuals whose conduct reflects discredit upon the force 
is but natural; but as a whole, there does not exist a more devoted, 
gallant, and efficient body of men than those composing the police of New 
York.</p>
<p>The Station Houses of the city are so arranged as to be central to their
respective precincts.&nbsp; The new buildings are models of their kind, and
the old ones are being improved as rapidly as possible.&nbsp; Perhaps the 
best arranged, the handsomest, and most convenient, is that of the Fourth 
Precinct, located at No. 9 Oak street.&nbsp; The locality is one of the 
worst in the city, and it is necessary that the police accommodations 
should be perfect.&nbsp; The building is of red brick, with a fine white 
granite fa&ccedil;ade, with massive stone steps leading from the street to 
the main entrance.&nbsp; The entrance leads directly to the main room, or 
office.&nbsp; On the right of the entrance is the Sergeant&rsquo;s desk, of
black walnut, massive and handsomely carved.&nbsp; Back of this is a fine 
book-case of the same material, for the record books and papers of the 
station.&nbsp; The telegraph instrument is at the side farthest from the 
windows&mdash;a precaution looking to its safety in case of a riot or 
attack on the station.&nbsp; Speaking-tubes, and boxes for papers, 
communicate with the other apartments.&nbsp; The walls are adorned with 
fine photographs of the late Superintendent Jourdan, the present 
Superintendent Kelso, and the Police Commissioners.&nbsp; Back of the 
office is the Surgeon&rsquo;s Room, with every convenience for the 
performance of the Surgeon&rsquo;s duties.&nbsp; The office of the Captain 
in command of the station is to the left of the entrance, and is fitted up 
with a Brussels carpet, and black walnut furniture.&nbsp; The walls are 
covered with fine engravings and photographs of prominent men.&nbsp; The 
Captain is also provided with a bed-room, bathroom, etc., which are 
elegantly furnished.&nbsp; The Sergeants&rsquo; <!-- page 180--><a 
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>bedrooms are large, 
airy, and well furnished.&nbsp; Bathrooms for the Sergeants and Patrolmen 
are located in the basement.&nbsp; The sleeping rooms of the Sergeants and 
Roundsmen, and four large dormitories for the Patrolmen, are situated on 
the second and third floors.&nbsp; Each Patrolman has a private closet for 
his clothing, etc., and each bedstead is stamped with the occupant&rsquo;s 
section number.&nbsp; The fourth story is used for store-rooms.&nbsp; On 
the first floor there is also a large sitting-room for the Patrolmen.</p>
<p>Attached to the Station House, and connected with it by a bridge, is the
prison, a brick building three stories in height.&nbsp; It is entered 
through the Patrolmen&rsquo;s sitting-room, and is the largest in any city 
station house.&nbsp; It contains fifty-two cells, all of which are of a 
good size and are well ventilated.&nbsp; Four of these (Nos. 1, 16, 17, 32)
are somewhat larger than the others, and are humorously called by the force
&ldquo;Bridal chambers.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are reserved for the more 
respectable prisoners.&nbsp; Over the prison are two large rooms designed 
for the unfortunates who seek a night&rsquo;s shelter at the 
station&mdash;one for men and the other for women.&nbsp; They are provided 
with board platforms to sleep on.&nbsp; These platforms can be removed, and
the whole place drenched with water from hydrants conveniently located.</p>
<p>As a matter of course, this model station is in charge of one of the 
most efficient, experienced, and reliable officers of the force.&nbsp; It 
is at present commanded by Captain A. J. Allaire, whose personal and 
official record fairly entitles him to the high and honorable position he 
holds in the force.</p>
<p>The station houses are kept scrupulously clean.&nbsp; Neatness is 
required in every department of the police service.&nbsp; The Inspector may
enter them at any hour, and he is almost sure to find them in perfect 
order.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span

<a href="images/p181.jpg">
<img alt="A WINTER NIGHT SCENE IN A POLICE STATION" src="images/p181.jpg"

</a></p>
<p>These stations afford a temporary shelter to the outdoor poor.&nbsp; In 
all of them accommodations are provided for giving a night&rsquo;s lodging 
to the poor wretches who seek it.&nbsp; When the snow lies white over the 
ground, or the frosts have driven them out of the streets, these poor 
creatures come in crowds to the station houses, and beg for a shelter for 
the night.&nbsp; You may see them huddling <!-- page 182--><a 
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>eagerly around the 
stove, spreading their thin hands to catch the warmth, or holding some 
half-frozen child to be thawed by the heat, silent, submissive, and 
grateful, yet even half afraid that the kind-hearted Sergeant, who tries to
hide his sympathy for them by a show of gruffness, will turn them into the 
freezing streets again.&nbsp; When the rooms devoted to their use are all 
filled, others still come, begging, ah, so piteously, to be taken in for 
the night.&nbsp; I think there is no part of the Sergeant&rsquo;s duties so
hard, so painful to him, as to be forced to turn a deaf ear to these 
appeals.&nbsp; Let us thank God, however, he does not do so often, and even
at the risk of being &ldquo;overhauled&rdquo; for exceeding his duty, the 
Sergeant finds, or makes, a place for those who seek his assistance in this
way.&nbsp; Many of those who seek shelter here are constant tramps, who 
have nowhere else to go.&nbsp; Others are strangers in the city&mdash;poor 
people who have come here in search of employment.&nbsp; Failing to find 
it, and what little money they brought with them being exhausted, they have
only the alternative of the station house or the pavement.&nbsp; Many who 
are simply unfortunate, suffer almost to perishing before seeking the 
station house, mistakenly supposing that in so doing they place themselves 
on a par with those who are brought there for offences against the 
law.&nbsp; But at last the cold and the snow drive them there, and they 
meet with kindness and consideration.&nbsp; I could not here present a 
description of the quiet and practical way in which the members of the 
&ldquo;Force&rdquo; relieve such sufferers.&nbsp; No record is kept of such
good deeds by the force, and the Sergeant&rsquo;s book is modestly silent 
on this subject; but we may be sure it is written in letters of living 
light on the great book that shall be opened at the last day.</p>
<p>The stations are connected with each other and with the headquarters by 
telegraph.&nbsp; The telegraph system has been so perfected that by means 
of a set of numbers struck on a bell, each of which refers to a 
corresponding number in the book of signals, questions are asked and 
answered, and messages sent from station to station with the greatest 
rapidity.</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the Police Force are located in a handsome building,
five stories high, known as No. 300 Mulberry <!-- page 183--><a 
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>street.&nbsp; The 
building extends through to Mott street, in the rear.&nbsp; It is situated 
on the easterly side of Mulberry street, between Bleecker and Houston 
streets.&nbsp; It is ninety feet in width.&nbsp; The Mulberry street front 
is of white marble, and the Mott street front is of pressed brick, with 
white marble trimmings.&nbsp; It is fitted up with great taste, and every 
convenience and comfort is provided for the members of the force on duty 
here.&nbsp; The greatest order is manifest.&nbsp; Everything and every man 
has a place, and must be in it at the proper times.&nbsp; There is no 
confusion.&nbsp; Each department has its separate quarters.</p>
<p>The Superintendent&rsquo;s office is connected by telegraph with every 
precinct in the city.&nbsp; By means of this wonderful invention, the 
Superintendent can communicate instantly with any point in the city.&nbsp; 
The news of a robbery or burglary is flashed all over New York and the 
adjoining country before a man has fairly secured his plunder.&nbsp; If a 
child is lost, all the precincts are furnished immediately with an accurate
description of it, and the whole force is on the lookout for the little 
wanderer, and in a marvellously quick time it is restored to its 
mother&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; By means of his telegraph, the Superintendent 
can track a criminal, not only all over the city, but all over the 
civilized world, and that without leaving his office.&nbsp; One of the most
interesting rooms in the headquarters is that for the trial of complaints 
against members of the force.&nbsp; Every charge must be sworn to.&nbsp; It
is then brought before the Commissioners, or rather before one who is 
appointed by the Board to hear such complaints.&nbsp; He notifies the 
accused to appear before him to answer to the charge.&nbsp; Except in very 
grave cases the men employ no counsel.&nbsp; The charge is read, the 
Commissioner hears the statements of the accused, and the evidence on both 
sides, and renders his decision, which must be ratified by the full 
&ldquo;Board.&rdquo;&nbsp; The majority of the charges are for breaches of 
discipline.&nbsp; A Patrolman leaves his beat for a cup of coffee on a cold
morning, or night, or reads a newspaper, or smokes, or stops to converse 
while on duty.&nbsp; The punishment for these offences is a stoppage of pay
for a day or two.&nbsp; First offences are usually forgiven.&nbsp; Many 
well-meaning but officious citizens <!-- page 184--><a 
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>enter complaints 
against the men.&nbsp; They are generally frivolous, but are heard 
patiently, and are dismissed with a warning to the accused to avoid giving 
cause for complaint.&nbsp; Thieves and disreputable characters sometimes 
enter complaints against the men, with the hope of getting them into 
trouble.&nbsp; The Commissioner&rsquo;s experience enables him to settle 
these cases at once, generally to the dismay and grief of the 
accuser.&nbsp; Any real offence on the part of the men is punished promptly
and severely, but the Commissioners endeavor by every means to protect them
in the discharge of their duty, and against impositions of any kind.</p>
<p>Another room in the headquarters is called &ldquo;The Property 
Room.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a genuine &ldquo;curiosity shop.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is filled with unclaimed property of every description, found by, or 
delivered to the police, by other parties finding the same, or taken from 
criminals at the time of their arrest.&nbsp; The room is in charge of the 
Property Clerk, who enters each article, and the facts connected with it, 
in a book kept for that purpose.&nbsp; Property once placed in this room is
not allowed to be taken away except upon certain specified 
conditions.&nbsp; Unclaimed articles are sold, after being kept a certain 
time, and the proceeds are paid to the Police Life Insurance Fund.</p>
<p>The pay of a policeman is small, being only about $1200 per annum.&nbsp;
In order to make some compensation for this deficiency, the Police Law 
contains the following provisions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any member of the Municipal Police Force, whilst in the actual
performance of duty, shall become permanently disabled, so as to render his
dismissal from membership proper, or if any such member shall become 
superannuated after ten years of membership, a sum of not exceeding $150, 
as an annuity, to be paid such member, shall be chargeable upon the 
Municipal Police Life Insurance Fund.&nbsp; If any member of the Municipal

186</span>VIII.&nbsp; THE BOWERY.</h2>
<p>Next to Broadway, the most thoroughly characteristic street in the city 
is the Bowery.&nbsp; Passing out of Printing House Square, through Chatham 
street, one suddenly emerges from the dark, narrow lane, into a broad 
square, with streets radiating from it to all parts of the city.&nbsp; It 
is not over clean, and has an air of sharpness and repulsiveness that at 
once attracts attention.&nbsp; This is Chatham Square, the great promenade 
of the old time denizens of the Bowery, and still largely frequented by the
class generally known as &ldquo;the fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the upper end of the square begins a broad, flashy-looking street, 
stretching away to the northward, crowded with pedestrians, street cars, 
and wheeled vehicles of all kinds.&nbsp; This is The Bowery.&nbsp; It 
begins at Chatham Square, and extends as far as the Cooper Institute, on 
Eighth street, where the Third and Fourth avenues&mdash;the first on the 
east, and the other on the west side of the Institute&mdash;continue the 
thoroughfare to the Harlem River.</p>
<p>The Bowery first appears in the history of New York under the following 
circumstances.&nbsp; About the year 1642 or 1643, it was set apart by the 
Dutch for the residence of superannuated slaves, who, having served the 
Government faithfully from the earliest period of the settlement of the 
island, were at last allowed to devote their labors to the support of their
dependent families, and were granted parcels of land embracing from eight 
to twenty acres each.&nbsp; The Dutch were influenced by other motives than
charity in this matter.&nbsp; The district thus granted was well out of the
limits of New Amsterdam, and they were anxious to make this negro 
settlement a sort of <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>breakwater against the attacks of the Indians,
who were beginning to be troublesome.&nbsp; At this time the Bowery was 
covered with a dense forest.&nbsp; A year or two later farms were laid out 
along its extent.&nbsp; These were called &ldquo;Boweries,&rdquo; from 
which the street derives its present name.&nbsp; They were held by men of 
mark, in those simple and honest days.&nbsp; To the north of Chatham Square
lay the broad lands of the De Lanceys, and above them the fine estates of 
the Dyckmans, and Brevoorts, all on the west of the present street.&nbsp; 
On the east side lay the lands of the Rutgers, Bayards, Minthornes, Van 
Cortlandts and others. Above all these lay the &ldquo;Bouwerie&rdquo; and 
other possessions of the strong-headed and hard-handed Governor Peter 
Stuyvesant, of whom many traces still exist in the city.&nbsp; His house 
stood about where St. Mark&rsquo;s (Episcopal) Church is now located.&nbsp;
In 1660, or near about that year, a road or lane was laid off through what 
are now Chatham street, Chatham Square and the Bowery, from the Highway, as
the portion of Broadway beyond the line of Wall street was called, to 
Governor Stuyvesant&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; To this was given the distinctive 
name of the &ldquo;Bowery lane.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some years later this lane was
continued up the island under the name of the &ldquo;Boston 
Road.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1783 the Bowery again came into prominent 
notice.&nbsp; On the 25th of November of that year, the American army, 
under General Washington, marched into the Bowery early in the morning, and
remained until noon, when the British troops evacuated the city and its 
defences.&nbsp; This done, the Americans marched down the Bowery, through 
Chatham and Pearl streets, to the Battery, where they lowered the British 
flag which had been left flying by the enemy, and hoisted in its place the 
&ldquo;stars and stripes&rdquo; of the new Republic.</p>
<p>After the city began to extend up the island, the Bowery commenced to 
lose caste.&nbsp; Decent people forsook it, and the poorer and more 
disreputable classes took possession.&nbsp; Finally, it became 
notorious.&nbsp; It was known all over the country for its roughs or 
&ldquo;Bowery B&rsquo;hoys,&rdquo; as they were called, its rowdy firemen, 
and its doubtful women.&nbsp; In short, it was the paradise of the worst 
element of New York.&nbsp; On this street the Bowery boy was in his 
glory.&nbsp; You might see him &ldquo;strutting along like <!-- page 
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>a 
king&rdquo; with his breeches stuck in his boots, his coat on his arm, his 
flaming red shirt tied at the collar with a cravat such as could be seen 
nowhere else; with crape on his hat, the hat set deftly on the side of his 
head, his hair evenly plastered down to his skull, and a cigar in his 
mouth.&nbsp; If he condescended to adorn his manly breast with any ornament
it was generally a large gold or brass figure representing the number of 
&ldquo;der mersheen&rdquo; with which he ran.&nbsp; None so ready as he for
a fight, none so quick to resent the intrusion of a respectable man into 
his haunts.&nbsp; So he had money enough to procure his peculiar garb, a 
&ldquo;mersheen&rdquo; to run with and fight for, a girl to console him, 
the &ldquo;Old Bowery Theatre&rdquo; to beguile him from his ennui, and the
Bowery itself to disport his glory in, he was content.&nbsp; Rows were 
numerous in this quarter, and they afforded him all the other relaxation he
desired.&nbsp; If there be any truth in the theories of Spiritualism, let 
us be sure his ghost still haunts the Bowery.</p>
<p>And the Bowery girl&mdash;who shall describe her?&nbsp; She was a 
&ldquo;Bowery b&rsquo;hoy&rdquo; in petticoats; unlike him in this, 
however, that she loved the greatest combination of bright colors, while he
clung religiously to red and black.&nbsp; Her bonnet was a perfect museum 
of ribbons and ornaments, and it sat jauntily on the side of her 
head.&nbsp; Her skirts came to the shoe top and displayed her pretty feet 
and well-turned ankle, equipped with irreproachable gaiters and the most 
stunning of stockings.&nbsp; One arm swung loosely to the motion of her 
body as she passed along with a quick, lithe step, and the other held just 
over her nose her parasol, which was sometimes swung over the right 
shoulder.&nbsp; Even the Bowery boy was overcome by her stunning 
appearance, and he forgot his own glory in his genuine admiration of his 
girl.</p>
<p>Well! they have passed away.&nbsp; The street cars, the new police, and 
the rapid advance of trade up the island, have made great changes here, but
there are still left those who could tell many a wondrous tale of the old 
time glories of the Bowery.</p>
<p>The street runs parallel with Broadway, is about double the width of 
that thoroughfare, and is about one mile in length.&nbsp; It is tolerably 
well built, and is improving in this respect every <!-- page 189--><a 
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>year.&nbsp; In 
connection with Chatham Square it is the great route from the lower end of 
the island to Harlem Bridge.&nbsp; Nearly all the east side street car 
lines touch it at some point, and the Third avenue line traverses its 
entire length.&nbsp; It lies within a stone&rsquo;s throw of Broadway, but 
is entirely different from it in every respect.&nbsp; Were Broadway a 
street in another city the difference could not be greater.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="THE BOWERY" src="images/p189.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Bowery is devoted mainly to the cheap trade.&nbsp; The children of 
Israel abound here.&nbsp; The display of goods in the shops flashy, and not
often attractive.&nbsp; Few persons who have the means to buy elsewhere 
care to purchase an article in the Bowery, <!-- page 190--><a 
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>as those familiar 
with it know there are but few reliable dealers in the street.&nbsp; If one
were to believe the assertions of the Bowery merchants as set forth in 
their posters and hand bills, with which they cover the fronts of their 
shops, they are always on the verge of ruin, and are constantly throwing 
their goods away for the benefit of their customers.&nbsp; They always sell
at a &ldquo;ruinous sacrifice;&rdquo; yet snug fortunes are realized here, 
and many a Fifth avenue family can look back to days passed in the dingy 
back room of a Bowery shop, while papa &ldquo;sacrificed&rdquo; his wares 
in front.&nbsp; Sharp practice rules in the Bowery, and if beating an 
unwilling customer into buying what he does not want is the highest art of 
the merchant, then there are no such salesmen in the great city as those of
this street.&nbsp; Strangers from the country, servant girls, and those 
who, for the want of means, are forced to put up with an inferior article, 
trade here.&nbsp; As a general rule, the goods sold here are of an 
inferior, and often worthless quality, and the prices asked are high, 
though seemingly cheap.</p>
<p>Pawnbrokers&rsquo; shops, &ldquo;Cheap Johns,&rdquo; third-class hotels,
dance houses, fifth-rate lodging houses, low class theatres, and concert 
saloons, abound in the lower part of the street.</p>
<p>The Sunday law is a dead letter in the Bowery.&nbsp; Here, on the 
Sabbath, one may see shops of all kinds&mdash;the vilest 
especially&mdash;open for trade.&nbsp; Cheap clothing stores, concert 
saloons, and the most infamous dens of vice are in full blast.&nbsp; The 
street, and the cars traversing it, are thronged with the lower classes in 
search of what they call enjoyment.&nbsp; At night all the places of 
amusement are open, and are crowded to excess.&nbsp; Roughs, thieves, 
fallen women, and even little children throng them.&nbsp; Indeed it is sad 
to see how many children are to be found in these places.&nbsp; The price 
of admission is low, and strange as it may sound, almost any beggar can 
raise it.&nbsp; People have no idea how much of the charity they lavish on 
street beggars goes in this way.&nbsp; The amusement afforded at these 
places ranges from indelicate hints and allusions to the grossest 
indecency.</p>
<p>Along the line of almost the entire street are shooting galleries, some 
of which open immediately upon the street.&nbsp; They are decorated in the 
most fanciful style, and the targets <!-- page 191--><a 
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>represent nearly 
every variety of man and beast.&nbsp; Here is a lion, who, if hit in the 
proper place, will utter a truly royal roar.&nbsp; Here is a 
trumpeter.&nbsp; Strike his heart with your shot, and he will raise his 
trumpet to his lips and send forth a blast sufficient to wake every Bowery 
baby in existence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only five cents a shot,&rdquo; cries the 
proprietor to the surrounding crowd of barefoot, penniless boys, and 
half-grown lads, &ldquo;and a knife to be given to the man that hits the 
bull&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many a penny do these urchins spend here in 
the vain hope of winning the knife, and many are the seeds of evil sown 
among them by these &ldquo;chances.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another gallery the 
proprietor offers twenty dollars to any one who will hit a certain 
bull&rsquo;s eye three times in succession.&nbsp; Here men contend for the 
prize, and as a rule the proprietor wins all the money in their pockets 
before the mark is struck as required.</p>
<p>The carnival of the Bowery is held on Saturday night.&nbsp; The 
down-town stores, the factories, and other business places close about five
o&rsquo;clock, and the street is thronged at an early hour.&nbsp; Crowds 
are going to market, but the majority are bent on pleasure.&nbsp; As soon 
as the darkness falls over the city the street blazes with light.&nbsp; 
Away up towards Prince street you may see the flashy sign of Tony 
Pastor&rsquo;s Opera House, while from below Canal street the Old Bowery 
Theatre stands white and glittering in the glare of gas and 
transparencies.&nbsp; Just over the way are the lights of the great German 
Stadt Theatre.&nbsp; The Atlantic Garden stands by the side of the older 
theatre, rivalling it in brilliancy and attractiveness.&nbsp; Scores of 
restaurants, with tempting bills of fare and prices astonishingly low, 
greet you at every step.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Lager Bier</i>,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;<i>Grosses Concert</i>; <i>Eintritt frei</i>,&rdquo; are the signs 
which adorn nearly every other house.&nbsp; The lamps of the street venders
dot the side-walk at intervals, and the many colored lights of the street 
cars stretch away as far as the eye can reach.&nbsp; The scene is as 
interesting and as brilliant as that to be witnessed in Broadway at the 
same hour; but very different.</p>
<p>As different as the scene, is the crowd thronging this street from that 
which is rushing along Broadway.&nbsp; Like that, it <!-- page 192--><a 
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>represents all 
nationalities, but it is a crowd peculiar to the Bowery.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;rich Irish brogue&rdquo; is well represented, it is true; but the 
&ldquo;sweet German accent&rdquo; predominates.&nbsp; The Germans are 
everywhere here.&nbsp; The street signs are more than one-half in German, 
and one might step fresh from the Fatherland into the Bowery and never know
the difference, so far as the prevailing language is concerned.&nbsp; Every
tongue is spoken here.&nbsp; You see the piratical looking Spaniard and 
Portuguese, the gypsy-like Italian, the chattering Frenchman with an 
irresistible smack of the Commune about him, the brutish looking Mexican, 
the sad and silent &ldquo;Heathen Chinee,&rdquo; men from all quarters of 
the globe, nearly all retaining their native manner and habits, all very 
little Americanized.&nbsp; They are all &ldquo;of the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
There is no aristocracy in the Bowery.&nbsp; The Latin Quarter itself is 
not more free from restraint.</p>
<p>Among the many signs which line the street the word 
&ldquo;<i>Exchange</i>&rdquo; is to be seen very often.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;Exchanges&rdquo; are the lowest class lottery offices, and they are 
doing a good business to-night, as you may see by the number of people 
passing in and out.&nbsp; The working people have just been paid off, and 
many of them are here now to squander their earnings in the swindles of the
rascals who preside over the &ldquo;Exchanges.&rdquo;&nbsp; These deluded 
creatures represent but a small part of the working class however.&nbsp; 
The Savings Banks are open to-night, many of them the best and most 
respectable buildings on the Bowery, and thousands of dollars in very small
sums are left here for safe keeping.</p>
<p>Many of the Bowery people, alas, have no money for either the banks or 
the lottery offices.&nbsp; You may see them coming and going if you will 
stand by one of the many doors adorned with the three gilt balls.&nbsp; The
pawnbrokers are reaping a fine harvest to-night.&nbsp; The windows of these
shops are full of unredeemed pledges, and are a sad commentary on the hope 
of the poor creature who feels so sure she will soon be able to redeem the 
treasure she has just pawned for a mere pittance.</p>
<p>Down in the cellars the Concert Saloons are in full blast, and the hot 
foul air comes rushing up the narrow openings as you <!-- page 193--><a 
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>pass them, laden with
the sound of the fearful revelry that is going on below.&nbsp; Occasionally
a dog fight, or a struggle between some half drunken men, draws a crowd on 
the street and brings the police to the spot.&nbsp; At other times there is
a rush of human beings and a wild cry of &ldquo;stop thief,&rdquo; and the 
throng sweeps rapidly down the side-walk overturning street stands, and 
knocking the unwary passer-by off his feet, in its mad chase after some 
unseen thief.&nbsp; Beggars line the side-walk, many of them professing the
most hopeless blindness, but with eyes keen enough to tell the difference 
between the coins tossed into their hats.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Bowery 
Bands,&rdquo; as the little street musicians are called, are out in force, 
and you can hear their discordant strains every few squares.</p>
<p>Until long after midnight the scene is the same, and even all through 
the night the street preserves its air of unrest.&nbsp; Some hopeful vender
of Lager Beer is almost always to be found at his post, seek him at what 
hour you will; and the cheap lodging houses and hotels seem never to 
close.</p>
<p>Respectable people avoid the Bowery as far as possible at night.&nbsp; 
Every species of crime and vice is abroad at this time watching for its 
victims.&nbsp; Those who do not wish to fall into trouble should keep out 
of the way.</p>
<h2><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
194</span>IX.&nbsp; PUBLIC SQUARES.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE BATTERY.</h3>
<p>The lowest and one of the largest of the pleasure grounds of the city, 
is the park lying at the extreme end of the island, at the junction of the 
Hudson and East rivers, and known as the Battery.&nbsp; At the first 
settlement of the Dutch, the fort, for the protection of the little colony,
was built at some distance from the extreme edge of the island, which was 
then rocky and swampy, but near enough to it to sweep the point with a 
raking fire.&nbsp; This fort occupied the site of the present Bowling 
Green.&nbsp; In 1658 Governor Stuyvesant erected a fine mansion, afterwards
known as &ldquo;The Whitehall,&rdquo; in the street now called by that 
name, but &ldquo;Capsey Rocks,&rdquo; as the southern point of the island 
was called, remained unoccupied.&nbsp; In 1693, the Kingdom of Great 
Britain being at war with France, the Governor ordered the erection of a 
battery &ldquo;on the point of rocks under the fort,&rdquo; and after 
considerable trouble, succeeded in obtaining from the Common Council, who 
were very reluctant to pay out the public money for any purpose not 
specified in the charter&mdash;a virtue which seems to have died with 
them&mdash;the sum necessary for that purpose.&nbsp; In 1734 a bill was 
passed by the General Assembly of the Province, ordering the erection of a 
battery on Capsey Rocks, and forbidding the erection of houses which would 
interfere with the fire of its guns, &ldquo;on the river, or on parts which
overflow with water, between the west part of the Battery, or Capsey Rocks,
to Ells Corner on the Hudson River,&rdquo; (the present Marketfield 
street).</p>
<p><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
195</span>During the years preceding the Revolution, and throughout that 
struggle, the Battery was used exclusively for military purposes.&nbsp; 
About the year 1792 measures were taken for filling up, enclosing, and 
ornamenting the place as a public park, to which use it has since been 
devoted.</p>
<p>During the first half of the present century the Battery was the 
favorite park of the New Yorkers, and was indeed the handsomest.&nbsp; The 
march of trade, however, proved too much for it.&nbsp; The fashion and 
respectability of the city which had clustered near it were driven up 
town.&nbsp; Castle Garden, which had been a favorite Opera House, was 
converted into an emigrant depot, and the Battery was left to the emigrants
and to the bummers.&nbsp; Dirt was carted and dumped here by the load, all 
sorts of trash was thrown here, and loafers and drunken wretches laid 
themselves out on the benches and on the grass to sleep in the sun, when 
the weather was mild enough.&nbsp; It became a plague spot, retaining as 
the only vestige of its former beauty, its grand old trees, which were once
the pride of the city.</p>
<p>In 1869, however, the spot was redeemed.&nbsp; The sea-wall which the 
General Government had been building for the protection of the land was 
finished, and the Battery was extended out to meet it.&nbsp; The old 
rookeries and street-stands that had clustered about Castle Garden were 
removed, the rubbish which had accumulated here was carted away, and the 
Battery was again transformed into one of the handsomest of the city 
parks.</p>
<p>It now covers an area of about twelve acres, and is tastefully and 
regularly laid off.&nbsp; Broad stone paved walks traverse it in various 
directions, and the shrubbery and flowers are arranged with the best 
possible effect.&nbsp; A tall flag-staff rises from the centre of the park,
and close by is a stand from which the city band give their concerts at 
stated times in the summer.&nbsp; A massive stone wall protects the harbor 
side from the washing of the waves, and at certain points granite stairs 
lead to the water.</p>
<p>The view from the Battery embraces a part of Brooklyn and <!-- page 
196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>the East 
River, Governor&rsquo;s and Staten islands, the Inner Bay, the Jersey 
shore, North River and Jersey City.&nbsp; The eye ranges clear down to the 
Narrows, and almost out to sea, and commands a view which cannot be 
surpassed in beauty.&nbsp; Here the sea breeze is always pure and fresh, 
here one may come for a few moments&rsquo; rest from the turmoil of the 
great city, and delight himself with the lovely picture spread out before 
him.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; THE BOWLING GREEN.</h3>
<p>At the lower end of Broadway there is a small circular public square, 
enclosed with an iron railing, and ornamented with a fountain in the 
centre.&nbsp; This is known as the Bowling Green, and is the first public 
park ever laid out in the city.</p>
<p>The first fort built by the Dutch on Manhattan island covered a good 
part of the site of this square.&nbsp; In 1733 the Common Council passed a 
resolution ordering that &ldquo;the piece of land lying at the lower end of
Broadway fronting the fort, be leased to some of the inhabitants of 
Broadway, in order to be inclosed to make a Bowling Green, with walks 
therein, for the beauty and ornament of the said street, as well as for the
recreation and delight of the inhabitants of this city, leaving the street 
on each side fifty feet wide.&rdquo;&nbsp; In October, 1734, the Bowling 
Green was leased to Frederick Philipse, John Chambers, and John Roosevelt, 
a trio of public spirited gentlemen, for ten years, for a Bowling Green 
only, and they agreed to keep it in repair at their own expense.&nbsp; In 
1741 a fire swept away the fort, and afforded a chance of improving the 
park, which was done.&nbsp; A change for the better was brought about in 
the neighborhood by the establishment of the grounds, and substantial 
houses began to cluster about it.</p>
<p>A few years before the Revolution, the Colonial Assembly purchased in 
England a leaden statue of King George the Third, and set it up in the 
centre of the Bowling Green, in <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>May 1771.&nbsp; The grounds at this time had 
no fence around them, as we learn from a resolution of the Common Council, 
and were made the receptacle of filth and dirt, thrown there, doubtless, by
the patriots as an insult to the royalists.&nbsp; As the troubles 
thickened, the people became more hostile to the statue of King George, and
heaped many indignities upon it, and after the breaking out of the war, the
unlucky monarch was taken down and run into bullets for the guns of the 
Continental army.</p>
<p>After the close of the Revolution, Chancellor Livingston enclosed the 
grounds with the iron fence which still surrounds them, and subsequently a 
fountain was erected on the site of the statue.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; THE PARK.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Park</span>&rdquo; is the title given by 
New Yorkers to the enclosure containing the City Hall and County 
Buildings.&nbsp; It originally embraced an area of eleven acres, but within
the past year and a half the lower end has been ceded to the General 
Government by the city, and upon this portion the Federal authorities are 
erecting a magnificent edifice to be used as a City Post Office.&nbsp; This
building covers the extreme southern end of the old Park, and the northern 
portion is occupied by the City Hall, the new County Court-House and the 
Department of Finance of the city and county.</p>
<p>In the days of the Dutch in New Amsterdam, the site of the Park, which 
was far outside the village limits, was set apart as a common, and was 
known as the &ldquo;Vlachte,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Flat,&rdquo; and subsequently
as the &ldquo;Second Plains,&rdquo; &ldquo;Commons,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Fields.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the common grazing ground of the 
Knickerbocker cows, and was by universal consent made public 
property&mdash;the first ever owned by the city.&nbsp; It is believed that 
previous to this it was the site of the village of the Manhattan Indians, a
belief which is strengthened by the frequent finding of Indian relics <!-- 
page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>in 
digging up the soil on this spot.&nbsp; It was connected with the Dutch 
village by a road which ran through a beautiful valley now known as Maiden 
lane.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p198.jpg">
<img alt="THE CITY HALL PARK" src="images/p198.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Every morning the village cowherd, who was a most important personage, 
would walk the streets of New Amsterdam and sound his horn at each 
burgher&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; The cows were immediately turned out to him, 
and when he had collected his herd he would drive them by the pretty valley
road to the commons, and there by his vigilance prevent them from straying 
into the unsettled part beyond.&nbsp; At a later period the mighty Dutch 
warriors whose prowess the immortal Deiderich Knickerbocker has celebrated,
made the commons their training ground, and here was also marshalled the 
force which wrested the city from the Dutch.&nbsp; Under the English it 
became a place of popular resort, and was used for public celebrations, the
town having <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
199</span>reached the lower limit of the commons.&nbsp; Here were 
celebrated his Majesty&rsquo;s birth-day, the anniversary of the Gunpowder 
Plot, and other loyal holidays, and here were held the tumultuous 
assemblies, the meetings of the Liberty Boys, and other demonstrations 
which preceded the Revolution.</p>
<p>In 1736 the first building, a Poor-House, was erected on the site of the
present City Hall.&nbsp; In 1747 a powder-house was erected by the city 
within the limit of the commons, near the site of the present City 
Hall.&nbsp; The gallows stood on the site of the new Post-office, and in 
1756 was removed to the vicinity of the present Five Points.&nbsp; In 1757 
the new jail, more recently known as the Hall of Records, was 
erected.&nbsp; In the same year, the old French war being in progress, 
wooden barracks were erected along the Chambers street front of the 
Park.</p>
<p>In 1757 a part of the site of the City Hall was laid out as a burying 
ground for the inmates of the Alms-House.&nbsp; In 1764 a whipping-post, 
stocks, cage, and pillory were erected in front of the new jail.&nbsp; In 
1755 a Bridewell was built on that portion lying between the City Hall and 
Broadway.&nbsp; After the Revolution, in 1785, the Park was first enclosed 
in its present form, by a post-and-rail fence, and a few years later this 
was replaced by wooden palings, and Broadway along the Park began to be 
noted as a fashionable place of residence.&nbsp; In 1816, the wooden fence 
gave way to an iron railing, which was set with due ceremonies by the city 
authorities.&nbsp; In 1795 a new Alms-House was built along the Chambers 
street front, but in 1812, Bellevue Hospital having been finished, the 
paupers were transferred thither, and the old building was refitted as a 
Museum.&nbsp; In 1802 the corner-stone of the present City Hall was 
laid.&nbsp; The building was finished in 1810.&nbsp; Some years later the 
old buildings were removed or converted into offices for the city and

<p>In 1870, the southern portion having been ceded to the Federal 
Government for the erection of a new Post-office thereon, the Park was laid
out on a new plan, and handsomely adorned with walks, shrubbery, fountains,
etc.&nbsp; It is now an ornament to the city.</p>
<h3><!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
200</span>IV.&nbsp; OTHER PARKS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Washington Square</span> is located between Fourth 
and Seventh streets, at the lower end of Fifth avenue.&nbsp; The site was 
originally a Potter&rsquo;s Field, and it is said that over one hundred 
thousand persons were buried here in days gone by.&nbsp; The square 
contains a little over nine acres, and is handsomely laid out, and adorned 
with a fountain, around which passes the main carriage drive, flowers, 
shrubbery, etc.&nbsp; The trees are among the finest in the city, and are 
kept with great care.&nbsp; An iron railing formerly surrounded the 
grounds, but in 1870-71 this was removed, and Fifth avenue was extended 
through the square to Laurens street.&nbsp; This street was widened and 
called South Fifth avenue, thus practically extending the avenue to West 
Broadway at Canal street.&nbsp; The square is surrounded by handsome 
residences.&nbsp; On the east side are the University of New York and a 
Lutheran Church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tompkins Square</span> is one of the largest in the 
city, and is laid off without ornament, being designed for a drill ground 
for the police and military.&nbsp; It occupies the area formed by avenues A
and B, and Seventh and Tenth streets.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Union Square</span>, lying between Broadway and 
Fourth avenue, and Fourteenth and Seventeenth streets, was originally a 
portion of the estate of Elias Brevoort.&nbsp; In 1762 he sold twenty acres
lying west of the &ldquo;Bowery Road&rdquo; to John Smith, whose executors 
sold it to Henry Spingler for the sum of &pound;950, or about $4750.&nbsp; 
The original farm-house is believed to have stood within the limits of the 
present Union Square.&nbsp; About the year 1807 Broadway was laid off to 
the vicinity of Twenty-second street, and in 1815 Union Square was made a 
&ldquo;public place,&rdquo; and in 1832 it was laid off as it now 
exists.&nbsp; The square is regular in shape, and the central portion is 
laid off as a park, and ornamented with shrubbery, flowers, walks, and a 
fountain.&nbsp; It is one of the prettiest parks in the city, and covers an
area of several acres.&nbsp; It is oval in form, and is without an 
enclosure.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Near the fountain is a thriving colony of English sparrows, imported and
cared for by the city for the purpose of protecting the trees from the 
ravages of worms, etc.&nbsp; The birds have a regular village of quaint 
little houses built for them in the trees.&nbsp; They frequent all the 
parks of the city, but seem to regard this one as their headquarters.&nbsp;
Some of the houses are quite extensive and are labelled with curious little
signs, such as the following: &ldquo;Sparrows&rsquo; Chinese Pagoda,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sparrows&rsquo; Doctor Shop,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sparrows&rsquo; 
Restaurant,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sparrows&rsquo; Station House,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; 
At the southeast angle of the square stands Hablot K. Browne&rsquo;s 
equestrian statue of Washington, a fine work in bronze, and at the 
southwest angle is his statue of Lincoln, of the same metal.&nbsp; The 
houses surrounding the square are large and handsome.&nbsp; They were once 
the most elegant residences in New York, but are now, with a few 
exceptions, used for business.&nbsp; Several hotels, the principal of which
are the Everett and Spingler Houses, front on the Square.&nbsp; On the 
south side, east of Broadway, is the Union Square Theatre, and <!-- page 
202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>on the west 
side, at the corner of Fifteenth street, Tiffany&rsquo;s magnificent iron 
building.&nbsp; In a few years the square will doubtless be entirely 
surrounded with similar structures.&nbsp; It is here that the monster mass 
meetings are held.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Stuyvesant Square</span> lies to the east of Union 
Square, and is bisected by the line of the Second avenue.&nbsp; Its upper 
and lower boundaries are Fifteenth and Seventeenth streets.&nbsp; It 
consists of two beautiful parks of equal size, surrounded by a handsome 
iron railing, and filled with choice flowers and shrubbery.&nbsp; In the 
centre of each is a fountain.&nbsp; These parks are the property of St. 
George&rsquo;s Church (Episcopal), which stands on the west side of the 
square at the corner, and were given to the corporation of that church by 
the late Peter G. Stuyvesant, Esq.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grammercy Park</span> lies midway between the Fourth
and Third avenues, and separates Lexington avenue on the north from Irving 
Place, really a part of the same avenue, on the south.&nbsp; Its northern 
and southern boundaries are Twentieth and Twenty-first streets.&nbsp; It is
tastefully laid out, is enclosed with an iron fence, and is kept locked 
against the public, as it is the private property of the persons living 
around it.&nbsp; On the east side the entire block is taken up by the 
Grammercy Park Hotel&mdash;a first-class boarding house&mdash;the other 
three sides are occupied by the residences of some of the wealthiest 
capitalists in America.&nbsp; Here dwell Peter Cooper, Moses Taylor, Cyrus 
W. Field, James Harper (of Harper &amp; Bros.), and others equally well 
known in the financial world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Madison Square</span> comprises about ten acres, and
lies at the junction of Broadway and the Fifth avenue.&nbsp; The latter 
street bounds it on the west, Madison avenue on the east, Twenty-third 
street on the south, and Twenty-sixth street on the north.&nbsp; It is 
nearly square in form, and is beautifully laid off.&nbsp; It has no fence, 
and this adds to the appearance of space which the neighboring open area 
gives to it.&nbsp; The Fifth Avenue Hotel, the Hoffman, Albemarle, and 
Worth Houses face it on the west, the Hotel Brunswick is on the north side,
and the Union League Club House and a handsome Presbyterian Church are on 
the east side along the line of Madison avenue.&nbsp; The land now <!-- 
page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
203</span>included in Madison Square was owned by the city from a very 
early period, and was used as a Potter&rsquo;s Field.&nbsp; In 1806 it was 
ceded to the United States for the erection of an Arsenal, for which 
purpose it was occupied for several years.&nbsp; In 1824 the &ldquo;Society
for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents&rdquo; obtained possession of 
the Arsenal grounds, on which they erected a House of Refuge, which was 
opened January 1st, 1825.&nbsp; This establishment consisted of two large 
stone buildings, and the grounds were enclosed with a stone wall seventeen 
feet high.&nbsp; In 1838 the House of Refuge was destroyed by fire, and a 
few years later Madison Square was laid out.&nbsp; It is now one of the 
most fashionable localities in the city, and the favorite promenade of the 
up-town people, who are drawn here in great numbers by the summer afternoon
concerts of the Central Park Band.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Reservoir Square</span> occupies the site of the old
Crystal Palace, and lies between Sixth avenue and the Croton Reservoir on 
Fifth avenue, and Fortieth and Forty-second streets.&nbsp; It has recently 
undergone great changes.&nbsp; It is a very pretty park, and is much 
frequented by the nurses and children of the adjacent neighborhoods.</p>
<h2><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
204</span>X.&nbsp; THE FIFTH AVENUE.</h2>
<p>The Fifth avenue, commencing at Washington Square, or Seventh street, 
and extending to the Harlem River, is said by the residents of New York to 
be the finest street in the world.&nbsp; It is about six miles in length, 
and is built up continuously from Washington Square to the Central Park, a 
distance of nearly three miles.&nbsp; From Fifty-ninth street to the upper 
end of the Central Park, One-hundred-and-tenth street, it is laid with the 
Nicholson or wooden pavement.&nbsp; It is being rapidly built up along its 
eastern side, the Park bounding the opposite side of the street, and this 
portion bids fair to be one of the most delightful and desirable 
neighborhoods in the city.&nbsp; In the vicinity of 
One-hundred-and-eighteenth street, the line of the avenue is broken by 
Mount Morris, an abrupt rocky height, which has been laid off as a pleasure
ground.&nbsp; Around this the street sweeps in a half circle, and from here
to the Harlem River, One-hundred-and-thirty-fifth street, it is lined with 
pretty villas, and paved with asphaltum.</p>
<p>From Madison Square to its lower end, the avenue is rapidly giving way 
to business, and its palatial residences are being converted into equally 
fine stores.&nbsp; Hotels and fashionable boarding-houses are thick in this
quarter.&nbsp; Above Madison Square the street is devoted to private 
residences, and this part is <i>par excellence</i> &ldquo;The 
Avenue.&rdquo;</p>

<img alt="FIFTH AVENUE, NEAR TWENTY-FIRST STREET." src="images/p205.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The principal buildings, apart from the residences, are the Brevoort 
House, at the corner of Clinton Place, an ultra fashionable 
hostelrie.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the street, at the northwest 
corner of Tenth street, is the handsome brown stone Episcopal Church of the
Ascension, and on the southwest corner of Eleventh street is the equally 
handsome First Presbyterian Church, constructed of the same material.&nbsp;
At the northeast corner of Fourteenth street is Delmonico&rsquo;s famous 
restaurant, fronting on both streets; and diagonally opposite, on the 
southwest corner of Fifteenth street, the magnificent house of the 
Manhattan Club.&nbsp; Not far from Delmonico&rsquo;s, and on the same side,
is a brick mansion, adorned with a sign bearing a coat of arms, and the 
announcement that the ground floor is occupied by the eighth wonder of the 
world, &ldquo;A Happy Tailor.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the southeast corner of 
Nineteenth street is the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, in charge of the
eloquent Dr. John Hall.&nbsp; Two blocks above, on the southwest corner of 
Twenty-first street, is the South Dutch Reformed Church, a handsome brown 
<!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
206</span>stone edifice, and diagonally opposite is the Glenham 
House.&nbsp; At the southwest corner of Twenty-second street, is the famous
art gallery of Gonpil &amp; Co., and immediately opposite the St. Germains 
Hotel.&nbsp; At Twenty-third street, Broadway crosses the avenue obliquely 
from northwest to southeast.&nbsp; On the left hand, going north, is the 
Fifth Avenue Hotel, and on the left Madison Square.&nbsp; The open space is
very broad here, and is always thronged with a busy, lively crowd.&nbsp; At
the northeast corner of Twenty-sixth street is the Hotel Brunswick, and on 
the southwest corner of Twenty-seventh street the Stevens House, both 
monster buildings rented in flats to families of wealth.&nbsp; At the 
northwest corner of Twenty-ninth street, is a handsome church of white 
granite, belonging to the Dutch Reformed faith, and familiarly known as the
&ldquo;Church of the Holy Rooster,&rdquo; from the large gilt cock on the 
spire.&nbsp; At the northwest corner of Thirty-fourth street is the new 
marble residence of Mr. A. T. Stewart, the most magnificent dwelling house 
in the land.&nbsp; Immediately opposite is a fine brown stone mansion, 
occupied at present by Mr. Stewart.&nbsp; On the southeast corner of 
Thirty-fifth street, is Christ Church (Episcopal), and on the northwest 
corner of Thirty-seventh street the Brick Church (Presbyterian), of which 
Dr. Gardiner Spring is the pastor.&nbsp; At Fortieth street, and extending 
to Forty-second, the west side of the avenue is taken up with the old 
distributing reservoir, a massive structure of stone, and immediately 
opposite is the Rutgers Female College.&nbsp; At the southeast corner of 
Forty-third street is the city residence of the notorious Boss Tweed, and 
at the northeast corner of the same street, the splendid Jewish synagogue 
known as the Temple E-manu-el.&nbsp; At the southwest corner of Forty-fifth
street is the Church of the Divine Paternity (Universalist), of which Dr. 
Chapin is the pastor, and on the opposite side of the street in the block 
above, the Church of the Heavenly Rest (Episcopal).&nbsp; At the northwest 
corner of Forty-eighth street is the massive but unfinished structure of 
the Collegiate Dutch Reformed Church.&nbsp; On the east side of the avenue,
and occupying the block between Fiftieth and Fifty-first streets, is the 
new St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, <!-- page 207--><a 
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>unfinished, but 
destined to be the most elaborate church edifice in America.&nbsp; The 
block above the Cathedral is occupied by the Male Orphan Asylum of the same
church, next door to which is the mansion of Madame Restelle, one of the 
most noted abortionists of New York.&nbsp; On the northwest corner of 
Fifty-third street is the new St. Thomas&rsquo; Church (Episcopal), a fine 
edifice, and owned by one of the wealthiest congregations in the 
city.&nbsp; Between Fifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth streets, and on the same 
side of the street, is St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, with its pretty 
grounds.&nbsp; On the east side, between Fifty-eighth and Fifty-ninth 
streets, and now in course of erection, will be located the Central Park 
Hotel, which is to be one of the most imposing structures in New York; and 
just opposite is the main entrance to the Central Park.</p>
<p>From Seventh to Fifty-ninth streets, the avenue presents a continuous 
line of magnificent mansions.&nbsp; There are a few marble, yellow stone, 
and brick buildings, but the prevailing material is brown stone.&nbsp; The 
general appearance of the street is magnificent, but sombre, owing to the 
dark color of the stone.&nbsp; Nearly all the houses are built on the same 
design, which gives to it an air of sameness and tameness that is not 
pleasing.&nbsp; But it is a magnificent street, nevertheless, and has not 
its equal in the great and unbroken extent of its splendor in the 
world.&nbsp; It is a street of palaces.&nbsp; Madison and Park avenues, and
portions of Lexington avenue, are nearly as handsome, as are the cross 
streets connecting them with the Fifth avenue, and many of the streets 
leading to the Sixth avenue are similarly built.&nbsp; The great defect of 
the avenue is the poverty of resource in the designs of the buildings, but 
this is the only species of poverty present here.</p>
<p>If the houses are palatial without, they are even more so within.&nbsp; 
Some of them are models of elegance and taste; others are miracles of 
flashy and reckless adornment.&nbsp; The walls and ceilings are covered 
with exquisite frescoes.&nbsp; The floors are rich in the finest and 
thickest of carpets, on whose luxurious pile no footfall ever sounds.&nbsp;
The light of the sun comes struggling in through the richest of curtains, 
and at night the <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>brilliancy of the gas is softened by the 
warmest tinted porcelain shades, or heightened by the dazzling reflection 
of crystal chandeliers.&nbsp; The drawing rooms are filled with the 
costliest and the richest furniture which is the perfection of comfort, and
with works of art worth a fortune in themselves.&nbsp; Back of these, or 
across the hall, through the half opened doors, you see the sumptuously 
furnished library, with its long rows of daintily bound books in their 
rosewood shelves.&nbsp; The library is a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; in most 
houses of the very wealthy, and in the majority of instances is more for 
ornament than for use.&nbsp; In the rear of all is the conservatory with 
its wealth of flowers and rare plants, which send their odors through the 
rooms beyond.&nbsp; The upper and lower stories are furnished on a 
corresponding scale of magnificence.&nbsp; Everything that money can 
procure for the comfort or luxury of the inmates is at hand.&nbsp; Nor are 
such residences few in number.&nbsp; They may be counted by the hundred, 
each with its contents worth a large fortune.&nbsp; The style of living is 
in keeping with the house, and, as a matter of course, only the very 
wealthy can afford such homes.</p>
<p>As for the occupants, they represent all classes&mdash;the good and the 
bad, the cultivated and the illiterate, the refined and the vulgar, the 
well-born and those who have risen from the gutters.&nbsp; If shoddy finds 
a home here, genuine merit is his neighbor.&nbsp; Those who have large and 
assured incomes can afford such a style of life; but they do not comprise 
all the dwellers on the Avenue.&nbsp; Many are here who have strained every
nerve to &ldquo;get into the Avenue,&rdquo; and who would sell body and 
soul to stay there, yet who feel that the crash is coming before which they
must give way.&nbsp; Others there are who would give half their possessions
to move in the society in which their neighbors live.&nbsp; They reside on 
the Avenue, but they are ignored by one class of its occupants, because of 
their lack of refinement and cultivation, and by another because of their 
inferiority in wealth.&nbsp; Great wealth covers a multitude of defects in 
the Avenue.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most restless, care-worn faces in the city are to be seen on
this street.&nbsp; Women clad in the richest attire pass you with unquiet 
face and wistful eyes, and men who are envied <!-- page 209--><a 
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>by their fellows for 
their &ldquo;good luck,&rdquo; startle you by the stern, hard set look 
their features wear.&nbsp; The first find little real happiness in the 
riches they have sold themselves for, and the latter find that the costly 
pleasures they courted have been gained at too dear a price.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="THE NEW RESIDENCE OF A. T. STEWART, ESQ." src="images/p209.jpg"

</a></p>
<p>Families are small in the Avenue, and Madame Restelle boasts, that her 
wealth has been earned in a large degree by keeping them so.&nbsp; Fashion 
has its requirements, and before them maternity must give way.&nbsp; Your 
fashionable lady has no time to give to children, but pets lap-dogs and 
parrots.</p>
<p>Well, the Avenue mansions have their skeletons, as well as the east side
tenement houses.&nbsp; The sin of the fashionable lady <!-- page 210--><a 
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>is covered up, 
however, and the poor girl must face the world.&nbsp; That is the 
difference.&nbsp; Madame married her husband for his money, and her love is
given to one who has no right to claim it; and what between her loathing 
for her liege lord and her dread of detection, she leads a life not to be 
envied in spite of the luxury which surrounds her.&nbsp; The liege lord in 
his turn, never suspecting his wife, but disheartened by her coldness to 
him, seeks his &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; elsewhere; and, by and by, the 
divorce court tells some unpleasant truths about the Avenue.</p>
<p>Contemplating these things, I have thought that the most wretched 
quarter of the city hardly holds more unhappy hearts than dwell along the 
three miles of this grand street; and I have thanked God that the Avenue 
does not fairly represent the better and higher phases of social and 
domestic life in the great city.</p>
<h2><!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
211</span>XI.&nbsp; STREET TRAVEL.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE STREET CARS.</h3>
<p>The peculiar shape of the island of Manhattan allows the city to grow in
one direction only.&nbsp; The pressure of business is steadily bringing the
mercantile district higher up the island, and compelling the residence 
sections to go farther to the northward.&nbsp; Persons in passing from 
their homes to their business go down town in the morning, and in returning
come up town in the evening.&nbsp; Those who live in the better quarters of
the city, or in the upper portion of the island, cannot think of walking 
between their homes and their business.&nbsp; To say nothing of the loss of
time they would incur, the fatigue of such a walk would unfit nine out of 
ten for the duties of the day.&nbsp; In consequence of this, street 
railways and omnibuses are more necessary, and better patronized in New 
York than in any city in the Union.</p>
<p>The street cars are the most popular, as they constitute the quickest 
and most direct means of reaching the most of the city localities.&nbsp; 
There are about twenty-two lines in operation within the city limits.&nbsp;
The majority of these run from north to south, and a few pass &ldquo;across
town&rdquo; and connect points on the North and East Rivers.&nbsp; A number
centre in Park Row at the new Post-office, and at the Astor House.&nbsp; 
The fare is usually five cents below Sixty-fifth street, and from six to 
eight cents to points above that street.</p>
<p>The Street Railway Companies are close corporations.&nbsp; Their <!-- 
page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>stock 
is very rarely in the market, and when it is offered at all sells readily 
at high prices.&nbsp; The actual dividends of these companies are large, 
often reaching as high as thirty-five per cent.&nbsp; This, however, is 
carefully concealed from the public, and the companies unite in declaring 
that the expenses of operating their roads are too heavy to admit of even a
moderate profit.&nbsp; This they do, no doubt, to excuse in some degree the
meanness with which they conduct their enterprises; for it is a striking 
fact that the heavier such a company&rsquo;s business grows, and the more 
its profits increase, the more parsimonious it becomes towards its 
employees and the public.</p>
<p>There is not a line in the city that has a sufficient number of cars to 
accommodate its patrons.&nbsp; More than one-half of those who ride on the 
cars are obliged to stand during their journey.&nbsp; As a rule, the cars 
are dirty and filled with vermin.&nbsp; The conductors and drivers are 
often appointed for political reasons alone, and are simply brutal 
ruffians.&nbsp; They treat the passengers with insolence, and often with 
brutality.</p>
<p>One meets all sorts of people on the street cars, and sometimes the 
contact is closer than is agreeable, and keeps sensitive people in constant
dread of an attack of the itch or some kindred disease.&nbsp; Crowded cars 
are much frequented by pick-pockets, who are said to be frequently in 
league with the conductors, and many valuable articles and much money are 
annually stolen by the light-fingered in these vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p213.jpg">
<img alt="NEW PALACE-CAR IN USE ON THE THIRD AVENUE LINE." 
src="images/p213.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>If the drivers and conductors are often deserving of censure, they have 
their grievances also.&nbsp; Their employers are merciless in their 
treatment of them.&nbsp; They lead a hard life, working about fifteen hours
out of every twenty-four, with no holidays.&nbsp; The conductors receive 
from $2.00 to $2.50 per day, and the drivers from $2.25 to $2.75.&nbsp; In 
order to make up the deficiency between their actual wages and their 
necessities, the conductors and drivers have fallen into the habit of 
appropriating a part of the money received from passengers to their own 
use.&nbsp; Many of them are very expert at this, but some are detected, 
discharged from the service of the company, and handed over to the 
police.&nbsp; The companies of course endeavor <!-- page 214--><a 
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>to put a stop to such
practices, but thus far have not been successful, and plead as their excuse
for the low wages they give, that this system of stealing prevents them 
from giving higher pay.&nbsp; Spies, or &ldquo;spotters,&rdquo; as the 
conductors term them, are kept constantly travelling over the roads to 
watch the employees.&nbsp; They note the number of passengers carried 
during the trip, and when the conductors&rsquo; reports are handed in, 
examine them and point out such inaccuracies as may exist.&nbsp; They soon 
become known to the men.&nbsp; They are cordially hated, and sometimes fare
badly at the hands of those whose evil doings they have exposed.&nbsp; This
practice of &ldquo;knocking down,&rdquo; or appropriating money, begins 
with the conductor, as he alone receives the money paid for fares.&nbsp; 
Those interested in it defend it on various grounds.&nbsp; The President of
the Third Avenue Railway Company, the principal horse-car line in the city,
once said to a reporter for a morning paper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We try and get all honest men.&nbsp; We discharge a man 
immediately if he is found to be dishonest.&nbsp; You see, conductors are 
sometimes made more dishonest by the drivers, who demand so much a day from
them.&nbsp; You have no idea how much a driver can worry a conductor if he 
wants to.&nbsp; For instance, he can drive a little past the corner every 
time when he ought to stop.&nbsp; He can be looking the other way when the 
conductor sees a passenger coming.&nbsp; He can run too fast, or let the 
car behind beat his, and so on, annoying the conductor continually.&nbsp; 
The only way the conductor can keep friends with him is to divide every 
night. . . . The conductors &lsquo;knock down&rsquo; on an average about 
thirty-five or fifty cents per day. . . . I don&rsquo;t think the practice 
can be entirely stopped.&nbsp; We try all we can.&nbsp; Some will do it, 
and others think they have the same right.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t stop it, 
but discharge a man mighty quick if he is detected.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Third 
Avenue line runs 200 cars, so that the loss of the company by the 
&ldquo;knock-down&rdquo; system is from $70 to $100 per day, or from 
$25,500 to $36,500 per annum.</p>
<p>A conductor gave his explanation of the system as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell ye.&nbsp; When a conductor is put on a road
he has to wait his turn before getting a car; it may be a month or <!-- 
page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>six 
weeks before he is regularly on.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll have to know the ropes 
or he&rsquo;ll be shelved before he knows it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll have to be 
a thief from the start or leave the road.&nbsp; His pay is $2 to $2.25 per 
day.&nbsp; Out of that sum he must pay the driver from $1 to $2 a day; the 
starter he has to conciliate in various ways.&nbsp; A lump of stamps is 
better than drinks and cigars, though drinks and cigars have a good deal of
influence on the roads; and then the &lsquo;spotter&rsquo; has to get $5 
every week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do the conductors allow themselves to be imposed on in this 
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; Because they can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; If they 
don&rsquo;t pay the driver, the driver will not stop for passengers, and 
the conductor is short in his returns; if they don&rsquo;t have a 
&lsquo;deal&rsquo; with the starter, the starter will fix him 
somehow.&nbsp; You see the driver can stop behind time, or go beyond it if 
he likes.&nbsp; The latest car in the street, you understand, gets the most
passengers.&nbsp; So it is that the drivers who are feed by the conductors 
stay from two to five minutes behind time, to the inconvenience of 
passengers, but to the profit of the driver, the conductor, the starter, 
the spotter, and for all I know, the superintendent and president of the 
company.&nbsp; It is a fine system from beginning to end.&nbsp; The amount 
of drink disposed of by some of the fellows in authority is perfectly 
amazing.&nbsp; I know a starter to boast of taking fifteen cocktails (with 
any number of lagers between drinks) in a day, and all paid for by the 
&lsquo;road;&rsquo; for, of course, the conductors saved themselves from 
loss.&nbsp; Oh, yes, you bet they did!&nbsp; The conductor&rsquo;s actual 
expenses a day average $5; his pay is $2.25, which leaves a fine tail-end 
margin of profit.&nbsp; How the expenses are incurred I have told 
you.&nbsp; What ken a man do?&nbsp; Honesty?&nbsp; No man can be honest and
remain a conductor.&nbsp; Conductors must help themselves, an&rsquo; they 
do!&nbsp; Why, even the driver who profits by the conductor&rsquo;s 
operations, has to fee the stablemen, else how could he get good 
horses?&nbsp; Stablemen get from $1 to $2 per week from each 
driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the system of horse railroad management is entirely

as they say: but it is not confined to the conductors.&nbsp; The worst 
thing about the car business though, and what disgusted me while I was in 
it, was the thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thieves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, the thieves.&nbsp; The pick-pockets, a lot of roughs get on 
your car, refuse to pay their fares, insult ladies, and rob right and 
left.&nbsp; If you object you are likely to get knocked on the head; if you
are armed and show fight you are attacked in another way.&nbsp; The thieves
are (or rather they were until lately) influential politicians, and tell 
you to your face that they&rsquo;ll have you dismissed.&nbsp; Ten to one 
they do what they say.&nbsp; I tell ye a man ought to have leave to knock 
down lively to stand all this.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; THE STAGES.</h3>
<p>The stages of New York are a feature of the great city, which must be 
seen to be appreciated.&nbsp; They are the best to be found on this 
continent, but are far inferior to the elegant vehicles for the same 
purpose which are to be seen in London and Paris.&nbsp; The stages of New 
York are stiff, awkward looking affairs, very difficult to enter or leave, 
a fact which is sometimes attended with considerable danger on the part of 
ladies.&nbsp; To ride in one is to incur considerable fatigue, for they are
as rough as an old-fashioned country wagon.&nbsp; Unlike the European 
omnibuses, they have no seats on top, but an adventurous passenger may, if 
he chooses, clamber up over the side and seat himself by the Jehu in 
charge.&nbsp; From this lofty perch he can enjoy the best view of the 
streets along the route of the vehicle, and if the driver be inclined to 
loquacity, he may hear many a curious tale to repay him for his extra 
exertion.</p>
<p>The stages, however, as inconvenient as they are, constitute the 
favorite mode of conveyance for the better class of New Yorkers.&nbsp; The 
fare on these lines is ten cents, and is sufficiently high to exclude from 
them the rougher and dirtier <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>portion of the community, and one meets with 
more courtesy and good breeding here than in the street cars.&nbsp; They 
are cleaner than the cars, and ladies are less liable to annoyance in 
them.&nbsp; Like the cars, however, they are well patronized by the 
pickpockets.</p>
<p>The driver also acts as conductor.&nbsp; The fares are passed up to him 
through a hole in the roof in the rear of his seat.&nbsp; The check-string 
passes from the door through this hole, and rests under the driver&rsquo;s 
foot.&nbsp; By pulling this string the passenger gives the signal to stop 
the stage, and in order to distinguish between this and a signal to receive
the passenger&rsquo;s fare, a small gong, worked by means of a spring, is 
fastened at the side of the hole.&nbsp; By striking this the passenger 
attracts the driver&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; A vigorous ringing of this 
gong by the driver is a signal for passengers to hand up their fares.</p>
<p>All the stage routes lie along Broadway below Twenty-third street.&nbsp;
They begin at some of the various East River ferries, reach the great 
thoroughfare as directly as possible, and leave it to the right and left 
between Bleecker and Twenty-third streets, and pass thence to their 
destinations in the upper part of the city.&nbsp; The principal lines pass 
from Broadway into Madison, Fourth and Fifth avenues, and along their upper
portions traverse the best quarter of the city.&nbsp; As the stages furnish
the only conveyances on Broadway, they generally do well.&nbsp; The flow 
and ebb of the great tide down and up the island in the morning and evening
crowd every vehicle, and during the remainder of the day, they manage by 
the exertions of the drivers to keep comfortably full.</p>
<p>The stage drivers constitute a distinct class in the metropolis, and 
though they lead a hard and laborious life, their lot, as a general thing, 
is much better than that of the car drivers.&nbsp; They suffer much from 
exposure to the weather.&nbsp; In the summer they frequently fall victims 
to sunstroke, and in the bitter winter weather they are sometimes terribly 
frozen before reaching the end of their route, as they cannot leave their 
boxes.&nbsp; In the summer they protect themselves from the rays of the sun
by means of huge umbrellas fastened to the roof of <!-- page 218--><a 
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>the coach, and in the
winter they encase themselves in a multitude of wraps and comforters, and 
present a rather ludicrous appearance.&nbsp; They are obliged to exercise 
considerable skill in driving along Broadway, for the dense throng in the 
street renders the occurrence of an accident always probable, and Jehu has 
a holy horror of falling into the hands of the police.&nbsp; Riding with 
one of them one day, I asked if he could tell me why it was that the 
policemen on duty on the street were never run over or injured in trying to
clear the thoroughfare of its frequent &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; of 
vehicles?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll never be one of them hurt by a driver accustomed 
to the street, sir,&rdquo; said he, dryly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather run over
the richest man in New York.&nbsp; Why, the police would fix you quick 
enough if you&rsquo;d run a-foul of them.&nbsp; It would be a month or two 
on the Island, and that&rsquo;s what none of us fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It requires more skill to carry a stage safely through Broadway than to 
drive a horse car, and consequently good stage-drivers are always in 
demand, and can command better wages and more privileges than the 
latter.&nbsp; They are allowed the greater part of Saturday, or some other 
day in the week, and as the stages are not run on Sunday, that day is a 
season of rest with them.</p>
<p>Like the street car conductors, they are given to the practice of 
&ldquo;knocking down,&rdquo; and it is said appropriate very much more of 
their employers&rsquo; money than the former.&nbsp; They defend the 
practice with a variety of arguments, and assert that it is really to their
employers&rsquo; interests for them to keep back a part of the earnings of 
the day, since in order to cover up their peculations, they must exert 
themselves to pick up as many fares as possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a 
fact, sir,&rdquo; said one of them to the writer, &ldquo;that them as makes
the most for themselves, makes the biggest returns to the 
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the drivers are very communicative on the subjects of their 
profession, and not a few tell some good stories of &ldquo;slouches,&rdquo;
&ldquo;bums,&rdquo; and &ldquo;beats,&rdquo; the names given to those 
gentlemen whose principal object in this world is to sponge upon poor 
humanity to as great an extent as the latter will <!-- page 219--><a 
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>permit.&nbsp; One of 
the cheapest ways of &ldquo;getting a ride&rdquo; is to present a five or 
ten dollar bill; very few drivers carry so much money, as they hardly ever 
have that amount on their morning trips; the bill cannot be changed, and 
the owner of it gets &ldquo;down town&rdquo; <i>free</i>.</p>
<p>Apropos of this method, a talkative Jehu said to me one morning, 
&ldquo;When I was a drivin&rsquo; on the Knickerbocker,&rdquo; a line that 
ran some twenty years ago from South Ferry through Broadway, Bleecker, and 
Eighth avenue, to Twenty-third street, &ldquo;there was a middle-aged man 
that used to ride reg&rsquo;lar; all the fellows got to knowin&rsquo; 
him.&nbsp; Well, he&rsquo;d get in and hand up a ten dollar note&mdash;you 
know the fare was only six cents then&mdash;and we never had so much 
&lsquo;bout us, so, of course, he&rsquo;d ride for nothin&rsquo;; well, 
that fellow stuck me five mornin&rsquo;s straight, and I sort o&rsquo; got 
tired of it; so on the six&rsquo; day I went to the office and says to the 
Boss, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a man ridin&rsquo; free on this line.&nbsp; All 
the fellows knows him; he gives &lsquo;em all a ten dollar note and they 
can&rsquo;t break it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s rid with me these last five 
mornin&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; for him to-day, I want ten 
dollars in pennies, an&rsquo; six fares out.&nbsp; If he rides I&rsquo;ll 
git square with him.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the Boss he gives me nine dollars and 
sixty-four cents all in pennies&mdash;you know they was all big ones 
then&mdash;an&rsquo; they weighed some, I tell you.&nbsp; When I got down 
to Fourteenth street he hailed me.&nbsp; Then the fares used to pay when 
they got out.&nbsp; So he hands up his note; I looked at it&mdash;it was on
the &ldquo;Dry Dock&rdquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; I hands him down the 
pennies.&nbsp; Well, how he did blow about it an&rsquo; said how he 
wouldn&rsquo;t take &lsquo;em.&nbsp; Well, says I, then I&rsquo;ll keep it 
all.&nbsp; Well, he was the maddest fellow you ever seen; he was 
hoppin&rsquo;!&nbsp; But he got out an&rsquo; some one inside hollers out, 
&lsquo;Put some one on the other side or you&rsquo;ll capsize,&rsquo; 
an&rsquo; he thought it was me.&nbsp; He jumped on the sidewalk an&rsquo; 
he called me everything he could lay his tongue to, an&rsquo; I a 
la&rsquo;ffin&rsquo; like blazes.&nbsp; Says he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll report 
you, you old thief,&rsquo; an&rsquo; I drove off.&nbsp; Well, I told the 
Boss, an&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;Let him come, I&rsquo;ll talk to 
him,&rsquo; but he never made no complaint there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said another: &ldquo;A lady got in with me one day an&rsquo; handed <!--
page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>up a 
fifty cent stamp.&nbsp; I put down forty cents.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t never 
look gen&rsquo;rally, but this time I see a man take the change an&rsquo; 
put it in his pocket.&nbsp; Pretty soon a man rings the bell an&rsquo; 
says, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the lady&rsquo;s change?&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, I 
thinks here&rsquo;s a go, an&rsquo; I points to the man and says, 
&lsquo;That there gentleman put it in his pocket.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, that 
fellow looked like a sheet, an&rsquo; a thunder-cloud an&rsquo; all through
the rainbow.&nbsp; He never said nothing but pulled out the change, gave it
up, an&rsquo; then he got out an&rsquo; went &lsquo;round a corner like 
mad.&nbsp; Some don&rsquo;t wait like he did tho&rsquo;, but gits out right
off.&nbsp; One day a chap got out an&rsquo; another follered him, an they 
had it out on the street there, an&rsquo; we all was a looking 
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes the drivers make &ldquo;a haul&rdquo; in a curious way.&nbsp; 
Said one: &ldquo;A man handed me up a fifty dollar bill one night.&nbsp; I 
handed it back four times, and got mad because he wouldn&rsquo;t give me a 
small bill.&nbsp; He said he hadn&rsquo;t anything else, and I could take 
that or nothing, so, I gave him change for a dollar bill, and kept 
forty-nine dollars and ten cents for his fare.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t say 
anything, and after a while he got out.&nbsp; Why, the other day a lady 
gave me a hundred dollar note, and when I told her I thought she&rsquo;d 
faint.&nbsp; &lsquo;My goodness!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t 
know it was more than one.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such people ought to be beat; 
they&rsquo;d be more careful when they lose a few thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fellows,&rdquo; said another driver, &ldquo;give you ten or 
fifteen cents, an&rsquo; swear they give you a fifty cent stamp, an&rsquo; 
you have to give them change for fifty cents, or they&rsquo;ll may be go to
the office an&rsquo; make a fuss, an&rsquo; the bosses will sooner take 
their word than yours, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll get sacked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the most laborious ways of &ldquo;turning an honest penny&rdquo; 
was brought to my notice by one of these knights of the whip.&nbsp; Said 
he: &ldquo;Has you been a watchin&rsquo; of my business this morning?&nbsp;
P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you aint took notice of the money I&rsquo;m 
takin&rsquo; in?&nbsp; No, I guess not.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter remark was 
followed by a rough laugh, in which I thought there was distinguishable a 
little more than mere merriment, especially when I heard a mumbled 
imprecation.&nbsp; He continued aloud: &ldquo;I aint seen any yet 
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon the bell rang, and a ticket was passed up.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
221</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; it 
strong, to be sure; this here&rsquo;s the fourteenth ticket I&rsquo;ve had 
on this trip.&rdquo;&nbsp; An explanation being solicited, the fact was 
revealed that there was a man inside who made a practice of buying twelve 
tickets for a dollar, then seating himself near the bell, he would take the
fares of every one and give the driver a ticket for each, that is, receive 
ten cents and give the driver the equivalent of eight and one-third cents, 
thereby making ten cents on every six passengers.&nbsp; &ldquo;You 
see,&rdquo; said the driver, &ldquo;what a blessin&rsquo; those sort of 
fellers is.&nbsp; Here I don&rsquo;t have no trouble whatsomever; he makes 
all the change for me, and &lsquo;spose my box should blow over, 
nothen&rsquo;s lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; From time to time as the tickets were 
handed up he would cheer the toiler inside with such expressions as 
&ldquo;Go it boots,&rdquo; &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the cash?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;How does the old thing work?&rdquo; always loud enough to attract 
the attention of the &ldquo;insides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This strange individual interested me so much that I made some inquiries
about him, at first supposing him to be crazy or otherwise terribly 
afflicted; but he is considered sound, is the third in a well-to-do firm, 
and is far beyond the need of having recourse to any such means for 
increasing his capital.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; STEAM RAILWAYS.</h3>
<p>The great necessity of New York is some sure means of rapid transit 
between the upper and lower parts of the island.&nbsp; The average New 
Yorker spends about an hour or an hour and a half each day in going to and 
from his business, and an immense amount of valuable time is thus lost, 
which loss is often increased by delays.&nbsp; For the past few years the 
citizens of the metropolis have been seeking to procure the construction of
a road from the Battery to Harlem to be operated by steam, and it seems 
probable now that a few years more will witness the completion of such a 
road.&nbsp; Public opinion is divided between two plans, and it is probable
that both will be tried, <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>and that the city will soon contain a steam 
railway elevated above the street and a similar road under the ground.</p>
<p>The elevated railway has already been tried to a limited extent, but is 
not regarded with much favor by the citizens.&nbsp; This line extends along
Greenwich street and Ninth avenue, from the Battery to Thirtieth 
street.&nbsp; The track of this road is laid on iron posts, at an elevation
of about sixteen feet above the street.&nbsp; The cars are so constructed 
that it would be impossible for one of them to fall from the track.&nbsp; 
Dummy engines furnish the motive power.&nbsp; The running time from the 
present southern terminus at Courtlandt street to Thirtieth street, a 
distance of about three miles, is fifteen minutes.&nbsp; The road is 
pronounced perfectly safe by competent engineers, but the structure appears
so light to the unscientific public that nine out of ten view it with 
distrust, and it is doubtful whether it will ever meet with the success the
company hope for.</p>
<p>The only other elevated road at present contemplated, and for which a 
liberal charter has been obtained, is known as the <i>Viaduct 
Road</i>.&nbsp; It is proposed to build this on a series of arches of solid
masonry, the streets to be spanned by light bridges.&nbsp; The line of the 
road is to be in the centre of the blocks along its route.&nbsp; The 
estimated cost of the road, including the sum to be paid for the right of 
way, is about $80,000,000; and it seems certain that this immense cost will
necessitate radical changes in the original plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p223.jpg">
<img alt="TUNNEL UNDER BROADWAY." src="images/p223.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The underground plan has many supporters in the city, these basing their
hopes upon the success achieved by the underground railway of London.&nbsp;
There are several plans proposed for an underground road.&nbsp; The first 
is known as the <i>Arcade Railway</i>.&nbsp; It is proposed by the friends 
of this plan to excavate the streets along which it passes to a depth of 
about twenty feet, or in other words, to make a new street twenty feet 
below the level of those already in existence.&nbsp; This new street is to 
be provided with sidewalks, gas-lamps, telegraph lines, hydrants, etc., and
upon the sidewalks the basements of the present buildings will open, thus 
adding an additional and valuable story to the existing edifices.&nbsp; The
lower street is to be arched over with solid <!-- page 224--><a 
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>masonry, rendered 
water-tight, and supported by heavy iron columns.&nbsp; Large glass plates,
similar to those now used for lighting the cellars of stores, will be 
placed in the sidewalks of the street above, and will furnish light to the 
lower street during the day.&nbsp; The roadway of the lower street will be 
entirely devoted to the use of railway trains.&nbsp; The proposed route of 
the <i>Arcade</i> line is from the Battery, under Broadway, to Union 
Square.&nbsp; Thence the eastern branch is to extend along Fourth avenue to
the Harlem River, while the western is to continue along Broadway to the 
junction of Ninth avenue, whence it will be prolonged to the northern end 
of the island.</p>
<p>The <i>Underground Railway</i> proper is to extend from the lower to the
upper end of the island, and is to pass through one or more tunnels, after 
the manner of the Underground Railway of London.</p>
<p>The third plan for an underground road, is the only one that has yet 
been attempted.&nbsp; It is known as the &ldquo;Beach Pneumatic 
Tunnel.&rdquo;&nbsp; A small section, several hundred yards in length, has 
been constructed under Broadway, and the company owning it claim that they 
have thus demonstrated their ability to construct and work successfully a 
road extending from the Battery to the upper end of the island.</p>
<p>The tunnel is eight feet in diameter.&nbsp; It commences in the cellar 
of the marble building of Messrs. Develin &amp;&nbsp; Co., at the southwest
corner of Broadway and Warren street, and extends under the great 
thoroughfare to a point a little below Murray street.&nbsp; It is dry and 
clean, is painted white, and is lighted with gas.&nbsp; It passes under all
the gas and water pipes and sewers.&nbsp; The cars are made to fit the 
tunnel, and are propelled by means of atmospheric pressure.&nbsp; A strong 
blast of air, thrown out by means of an immense blowing machine, is forced 
against the rear end of a car, and sends it along the track like a 
sail-boat before the wind.&nbsp; This current of course secures perfect 
ventilation within the car.&nbsp; The company claim that they will be able,
when their road is completed, to transport more than 20,000 passengers per 
hour, each way.</p>
<h2><!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
225</span>XII.&nbsp; HORACE GREELEY.</h2>
<p>The best known man in New York, in one sense, and the least known in 
others, is Horace Greeley.&nbsp; If there is a man, woman, or child in all 
this broad land who has not heard of him, let that person apply to Barnum 
for an engagement as a natural curiosity.&nbsp; And yet how few know the 
man as he really is.&nbsp; The most absurd stories are told of him, and the
likeness most familiar to the public is a ridiculous caricature.</p>
<p>He was born in Amherst, New Hampshire, on the 3d of February, 1811, and 
is consequently 61 years old.&nbsp; His parents were poor, and Horace 
received but a very plain education at the common schools of the 
vicinity.&nbsp; The natural talent of the boy made up for this, however, 
for he read everything he could lay his hands on.&nbsp; He was a rapid 
reader, too, and had the faculty of retaining the information thus 
acquired.&nbsp; He was kept too busy at work on his father&rsquo;s sterile 
farm to be able to read during the day, and he was too poor to afford to 
use candles at night, and so his early studies were carried on by the light
of pine knots.&nbsp; He served a severe apprenticeship at the printing 
business, commencing it at a very early age, and finding employment first 
on one country paper, and then on another, working at his trade, and 
occasionally writing for the journals he put in type.</p>
<p>In 1831 he came to New York, convinced that the great city offered him a
better opportunity for success than any other place, and resolved to win 
that success.&nbsp; He was very boyish in appearance, frail, 
delicate-looking, but hopeful and resolved.&nbsp; For ten years he worked 
hard in the various offices of the city, sometimes setting type and 
sometimes writing editorials.&nbsp; Sometimes he published his own journal,
but generally found this a <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>&ldquo;losing business.&rdquo;&nbsp; Failure 
did not discourage him, and he kept on, acquiring greater experience and 
becoming better known every year.&nbsp; He has himself told so well the 
story of his early struggles to so large an audience that I need not repeat
it here.</p>
<p>In 1841, ten years from the time he wandered along Nassau street, 
without money or friends, and with all his worldly possessions tied up in a
handkerchief, he began the publication of the <i>New York Tribune</i>, 
having succeeded in obtaining the necessary capital.&nbsp; It was a 
venture, and a bold one, but it proved a great success.&nbsp; He chose the 
name of the journal himself, and became its responsible editor.&nbsp; 
Though others have assisted him in his efforts, the success of the paper is
his work.&nbsp; He has made it a great power in the land, and he is 
naturally proud of his work.&nbsp; Those who know him best say that the 
title dearest to his heart is that of &ldquo;Founder of the New York 
Tribune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Greeley&rsquo;s career has been one of incessant labor.&nbsp; His 
friends say he was never known to rest as other men do.&nbsp; When he goes 
to his farm in Westchester County for recreation, he rests by chopping wood
and digging ditches.&nbsp; His editorial labors make up a daily average of 
about two columns of the <i>Tribune</i>, and he contributes the equivalent 
of about six <i>Tribune</i> columns per week to other journals.&nbsp; He 
writes from fifteen to twenty-five letters per day; he has published 
several large works; he goes thoroughly through his exchanges every day, 
and keeps himself well posted in the current literature of the times; he 
speaks or lectures about five or six times a month, and makes monthly 
visits to Albany and Washington, to see what is going on behind the scenes 
in the capitals of the State and Nation.&nbsp; He is constantly receiving 
people who come on business or from curiosity, and yet he never seems 
tired, though he is not always even-tempered.</p>
<p>He is somewhat peculiar in his personal appearance.&nbsp; Most people in
thinking of him picture to themselves a slouchy looking man, with a white 
hat, a white overcoat, with one leg of his breeches caught over the top of 
his boot, his whole dress shabby <!-- page 227--><a 
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>and not overclean, 
and his pockets stuffed full of newspapers, and many have imagined that he 
&ldquo;gets himself up&rdquo; so, in order to attract attention on the 
streets.&nbsp; The true Horace Greeley, however, though careless as to 
outward appearances, is immaculately neat in his dress.&nbsp; No one ever 
saw him with dirty linen or soiled clothes except in muddy weather, when, 
in New York, even a Brummel must be content to be splashed with mud.&nbsp; 
Mr. Greeley&rsquo;s usual dress is a black frock coat, a white vest, and a 
pair of black pantaloons which come down to the ankle.&nbsp; His black 
cravat alone betrays his carelessness, and that only when it slips off the 
collar, and works its way around to the side.&nbsp; Mr. Greeley is five 
feet ten inches in height, and is stout in proportion.&nbsp; He is partly 
bald, and his hair is white.&nbsp; He has a light, pinkish complexion, and 
his eyes are blue, small, and sunken.&nbsp; His mouth is well-shaped, and 
his features are regular.&nbsp; His beard is worn around the throat and 
under the chin, and is perfectly white.&nbsp; His hands are small and soft;
but his feet and legs are awkward and clumsy, and this gives to him a 
peculiar shuffling motion in walking.&nbsp; He is abstracted in manner, and
when accosted suddenly replies abruptly, and as some think rudely.</p>
<p>One of his acquaintances thus describes him in his editorial office:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We walk through the little gate in the counter, turn within the 
open doorway on our left, climb a short, narrow flight of stairs, and find 
ourselves in a small room, ten by fifteen, furnished with a green carpet, a
bed lounge, an open book-rack, a high desk, a writing-desk, three 
arm-chairs, a short-legged table, and a small marble sink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Greeley&rsquo;s back is toward us.&nbsp; He is seated at his 
desk.&nbsp; His head is bent over his writing, and his round shoulders are 
quite prominent.&nbsp; He is scribbling rapidly.&nbsp; A quire of foolscap,
occupying the only clear space on his desk, is melting rapidly beneath his 
pen.&nbsp; The desk itself is a heap of confusion.&nbsp; Here is Mr. 
Greeley&rsquo;s straw hat; there is his handkerchief.&nbsp; In front of him
is a peck of newspaper clippings, not neatly rolled up, but loosely 
sprawled over the desk.&nbsp; At his left a rickety <!-- page 228--><a 
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>pair of scissors 
catches a hurried nap, and at his right a paste-pot and a half-broken box 
of wafers appear to have had a rough-and-tumble fight.&nbsp; An odd-looking
paper-holder is just ready to tumble on the floor.&nbsp; An old-fashioned 
sand-box, looking like a dilapidated hour-glass, is half-hidden under a 
slashed copy of <i>The New York World</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Greeley still sticks 
to wafers and sand, instead of using mucilage and blotting-paper.&nbsp; A 
small drawer, filled with postage stamps and bright steel pens, has crawled
out on the desk.&nbsp; Packages of folded missives are tucked in the 
pigeon-holes, winking at us from the back of the desk, and scores of 
half-opened letters, mixed with seedy brown envelopes, flop lazily about 
the table.&nbsp; Old papers lie gashed and mangled about his chair, the 
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of a literary battle field.&nbsp; A clean towel hangs 
on a rack to his right.&nbsp; A bound copy of <i>The Tribune Almanac</i>, 
from 1838 to 1868, swings from a small chain fastened to a staple screwed 
in the side of his desk; two other bound volumes stand on their feet in 
front of his nose, and two more of the same kind are fast asleep on the 
book-rack in the corner.&nbsp; Stray numbers of the almanac peep from every
nook.&nbsp; The man who would carry off Greeley&rsquo;s bound pile of 
almanacs would deserve capital punishment.&nbsp; The Philosopher could 
better afford to lose one of his legs than to lose his almanacs.&nbsp; The 
room is kept scrupulously clean and neat.&nbsp; A waste paper basket squats
between Mr. Greeley&rsquo;s legs, but one half the torn envelopes and boshy
communications flutter to the floor instead of being tossed into the 
basket.&nbsp; The table at his side is covered with a stray copy of <i>The 
New York Ledger</i>, and a dozen magazines lie thereon.&nbsp; Here is an 
iron garden rake wrapped up in an <i>Independent</i>.&nbsp; There hangs a 
pair of handcuffs once worn by old John Brown, and sent Mr. Greeley by an 
enthusiastic admirer of both Horace and John.&nbsp; A champagne basket, 
filled with old scrap-books and pamphlets, occupies one corner.&nbsp; A 
dirty bust of Lincoln, half hidden in dusty piles of paper, struggles to be
seen on the top of his desk.&nbsp; A pile of election tables, dirty, ragged
and torn, clipped from some unknown newspaper, looks as if they had half a 
mind to jump down on the &lsquo;Old Man&rsquo;s&rsquo; bald head.&nbsp; A

and maps of the World, New York, and New Jersey hang on the wall.&nbsp; A 
rare geological specimen of quartz rock, weighing about ten pounds, is 
ready to roll down a high desk to the floor on the first alarm.&nbsp; Dirty
pamphlets are as plentiful as cockroaches.&nbsp; His office library 
consists of 150 volumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pen, ink, paper, scissors, and envelopes are in unfailing 
demand.&nbsp; The cry, &lsquo;Mr. Greeley wants writing paper!&rsquo; 
creates a commotion in the counting-room, and Mr. Greeley gets paper 
quicker than a hungry fisherman could skin an eel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Greeley can lay Virginia worm fences in ink faster than any 
other editor in New York City.&nbsp; He uses a fountain-pen, a present from
some friend.&nbsp; He thinks a great deal of it, but during an experience 
of three years has failed to learn the simple principle of suction without 
getting his mouth full of ink, and he generally uses it with an empty 
receiver.&nbsp; He makes a dash at the ink-bottle every twenty seconds, 
places the third finger and thumb of his left hand on his paper, and 
scratches away at his worm fence like one possessed.&nbsp; He writes 
marvellously fast.&nbsp; Frequently the point of his pen pricks through his
sheet, for he writes a heavy hand, and a snap follows, spreading inky spots
over the paper, resembling a woodcut portraying the sparks from a 
blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer.&nbsp; Blots like mashed spiders, or crushed 
huckleberries, occasionally intervene, but the old veteran dashes them with
sand, leaving a swearing compositor to scratch off the soil, and dig out 
the words underneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Greeley&rsquo;s manuscript, when seen for the first time, 
resembles an intricate mass of lunatic hieroglyphics, or the tracks of a 
spider suffering from <i>delirium tremens</i>.&nbsp; But, by those 
accustomed to his writing, a remarkable exactness is observed.&nbsp; The 
spelling, punctuation, accented letters, and capitalizing are 
perfect.&nbsp; The old type-setters of the office prefer his manuscript 
above that of any other editor, for the simple reason that he writes his 
article as he wishes it to appear, and rarely, if ever, cuts or slashes a 
proof-sheet.&nbsp; And this punctuality is, in a great measure, a feature 
of his life.&nbsp; He is always in time, and never waits for anybody.&nbsp;
He employs no private secretary, and <!-- page 230--><a 
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>when he receives a 
letter, answers it on the instant.&nbsp; No matter how trivial the request,
the next outward-bound mail will carry away one of his autographs, if he 
thinks an answer necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows we have entered his room, yet he continues his 
writing.&nbsp; The only sound we hear within the sanctum is the scratch of 
his pen.&nbsp; He has the power of concentrating all the strength of his 
mind on the subject of his editorial, and will pay no attention to any 
question, however important, until he finishes his sentence.&nbsp; If the 
cry of &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; should resound through the building, Greeley 
would finish his sentence and ring his bell before he would leave his 
room.&nbsp; The sentence complete, he places the forefinger of his right 
hand at the end of the word last written, seizes the handle of his pen in 
his teeth, and looks his tormentor full in the face.&nbsp; It is a glance 
of inquiry, and the questioner, intuitively conscious of this fact, repeats
his interrogation.&nbsp; Mr. Greeley divines the question before it is 
finished, and answers it pithily and quickly.&nbsp; The pen is then 
snatched from his mouth, dexterously dipped into his inkstand, and his 
fingers again travel across his transverse sheet of foolscap like a 
&lsquo;daddy-long-legs&rsquo; caught in a storm.&nbsp; If his questioner is
importunate, and insists on wasting his time, he continues his writing, 
never looking up, and either answers absent-mindedly, or in a low, 
impatient tone, tinged with a peculiar boyish nervousness.&nbsp; If his 
visitor is ungentlemanly enough to still continue his teasing 
importunities, a storm breaks forth, and the uncourteous person will trot 
out of the sanctum with an answer ringing in his ears that should bring a 
flush to his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mr. Greeley time is more valuable than money or even 
friendship.&nbsp; When busy, he is no respecter of persons.&nbsp; President
or hod-carrier, general or boot-black, clergyman or express-driver, 
authoress or apple-woman&mdash;all are treated alike.&nbsp; Eminent men 
have left his room under the impression that they have been deliberately 
slighted, while Horace still slashed away at his inky pickets, totally 
unconscious of any neglect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Greeley&rsquo;s home is at Chappaqua, in Westchester County, New 
York, about thirty miles from the city.&nbsp; He owns a fine farm of about 
forty acres, which has cost him more money than <!-- page 231--><a 
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>he would care to 
tell.&nbsp; Agriculture is one of his great hobbies, and he tests here all 
the theories that are presented to him.&nbsp; His friends say that his 
turnips cost him about ten dollars apiece to produce, and bring about fifty
cents per bushel in the market, and that all his farming operations are 
conducted on the same principle.</p>

<img alt="HORACE GREELEY." src="images/p4.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Mr. Greeley married when quite young, and has had three children.&nbsp; 
Two daughters, aged about twenty and twelve, are living, but his son, a 
bright and unusually promising child, died some years ago.&nbsp; Mr. 
Greeley is one of the principal stockholders in the <i>Tribune</i>, and is 
a rich man.&nbsp; He is liberal and generous to those in need, and is a 
warm friend to benevolent enterprises of all kinds.</p>
<p>The chief reason of his popularity is the general confidence of the 
people in his personal integrity.&nbsp; Not even his political enemies 
question his honesty&mdash;and surely in these days of corruption and crime
in public life, an honest man is one that can not well be spared.</p>

232</span>XIII.&nbsp; THE TOMBS.</h2>
<p>Turn out of Printing House Square, leaving the City Hall on your left, 
and pass up Centre street for about a quarter of a mile, and you will come 
to a massive granite edifice in the Egyptian style of architecture.&nbsp; 
It occupies an entire square, and is bounded by Centre and Elm, and Leonard
and Franklin streets.&nbsp; The main entrance is on Centre street, and is 
approached by a broad flight of granite steps, which lead to a portico 
supported by massive Egyptian columns.&nbsp; The proper name of the edifice
is <i>The Halls of Justice</i>, but it is popularly known all over the 
Union as <i>The Tombs</i>, which name was given to it in consequence of its
gloomy appearance.&nbsp; It occupies the site of the old Collect Pond which
once supplied the citizens of New York with drinking water, was begun in 
1835 and completed in 1838.</p>
<p>The outer building occupies four sides of a hollow square, and is 253 by
200 feet in size.&nbsp; It was built at a time when New York contained 
scarcely half its present population, and has long since ceased to be equal
to the necessities of the city.&nbsp; The site is low and damp, and the 
building is badly ventilated.&nbsp; The warden does all in his power to 
counteract these evils, and keeps the place remarkably neat, but it is 
still a terribly sickly and dreary abode.&nbsp; It was designed to 
accommodate about 200 prisoners, but for some years past the number of 
prisoners confined here at one time has averaged 400, and has sometimes 
exceeded that average.&nbsp; The Grand Jury of the County have recently 
condemned the place as a nuisance, and it is believed that the city will 
ere long possess a larger, cleaner, and more suitable prison.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>
<a href="images/p233.jpg">
<img alt="THE TOMBS." src="images/p233.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>When the prison was built the Five Points, on the western verge of which
it lies, was a much worse section than it is now.&nbsp; It is bad enough at
present, but then the Tombs constituted a solitary island in a sea of crime
and suffering.&nbsp; A terrible island it was, too.</p>
<p>Entering through the gloomy portal upon which the sunlight never falls, 
the visitor is chilled with the dampness which greets him as soon as he 
passes into the shadow of the heavy columns.&nbsp; Upon reaching the inner 
side of the enclosure, he finds that the portion of the prison seen from 
the street encloses a large courtyard, in the centre of which stands a 
second prison, 142 feet long by 45 feet deep, and containing 148 
cells.&nbsp; This is the male prison, and is connected with the outer 
building by a bridge known as the <i>Bridge of Sighs</i>, since it is by 
means of it that condemned criminals pass from their cells to the scaffold 
at the time of their execution.</p>
<p>The gallows is taken down and kept in the prison until there is need for
it.&nbsp; Then it is set up in the courtyard near the Bridge of 
Sighs.&nbsp; All executions are conducted here in private, that is, they 
are witnessed only by such persons as the officers of the law may see fit 
to admit.&nbsp; But on such days the neighboring buildings are black with 
people, seeking to look down <!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>over the prison walls and witness the death 
agonies of the poor wretch who is paying the penalty of the law.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p234.jpg">
<img alt="THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS." src="images/p234.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The interior of the male prison consists of a narrow and lofty hall, 
upon which open four tiers of cells, one above another; those above the 
ground floor being reached by light iron galleries.&nbsp; Each gallery is 
guarded by two keepers.&nbsp; The cells are narrow, and each is lighted by 
a small iron-barred window at the farther end.&nbsp; Light and air are also
admitted by the barred door of iron opening upon the corridor.&nbsp; There 
are eleven cells of especial strength, in which convicts condemned to death
or to the State Prison are confined.&nbsp; There are six other cells, which
are used for the confinement of persons charged with offences less grave, 
and six more, which are used for sick prisoners.&nbsp; The cells are 
generally full of criminals.&nbsp; Some of them are well furnished, and are
provided with carpets, chairs, a table, and books and paper, which are 
bought at the expense of the prisoner or his friends.&nbsp; Some of the 
inmates shrink from the observation of visitors, but others are hardened to
crime and shame, and not unfrequently cause the visitor&rsquo;s ears to 
tingle with the remarks they address to them.&nbsp; <!-- page 236--><a 
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>No lights are allowed
in the cells, and the aspect of the place is very gloomy, the whole prison 
is kept scrupulously clean, the sanitary regulations being very strict, but
the lack of room necessitates the crowding of the prisoners to a fearfully 
demoralizing extent.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p235.jpg">
<img alt="INTERIOR OF MALE PRISON." src="images/p235.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The outer building contains the female prison, which lies along the 
Leonard street side, the boys&rsquo; prison, and the halls of justice, or 
rooms occupied by the Tombs Police Court and the Court of Special 
Sessions.&nbsp; Over the main entrance on the Centre street side, are six 
comfortable cells.&nbsp; These are for the use of criminals of the 
wealthier class, who can afford to pay for such comforts.&nbsp; Forgers, 
fraudulent merchants, and the like, pass the hours of their detention in 
these rooms, while their humbler but not more guilty brothers in crime are 
shut in the close cells of the male prison.&nbsp; These rooms command a 
view of the street, so that their occupants are not entirely cut off from 
the outer world.</p>
<p>The female prison is in charge of an excellent matron, who has held her 
position for more than twenty years.&nbsp; Men are never confined here, and
male visitors are subject to certain restrictions.&nbsp; In this portion is
located the room used as a chapel.&nbsp; Religious services of some kind 
are held in the Tombs every day in the week except Saturday, and the effort
is made to give all the denominations an opportunity of doing good.&nbsp; 
Sunday morning and Tuesday until noon are devoted to the Roman Catholics; 
Sunday and Tuesday afternoons to the Episcopalians; Monday to the 
Methodists, and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to the other Protestant 
denominations.&nbsp; Some of the Protestant clergy sometimes attempt to 
hold religious services in the main hall of the male prison, so that the 
prisoners in their cells may hear what is going on.&nbsp; The latter pay 
little or no attention to the preacher, and frequently interrupt and annoy 
him by their shouts, jeers and imitations in their cells.&nbsp; The Sisters
of Charity are in charge of the female and boys&rsquo; prisons, and do a 
vast amount of good by their quiet ministrations.&nbsp; The boys are kept 
in a large room during the day, and are locked up in separate cells at 
night.</p>

<img alt="THE PRISON CHAPEL." src="images/p237.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>One of the principal rooms in the Tombs is &ldquo;The Bummers&rsquo; 
Cell.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a large apartment, shut off from one of the main 
halls by an iron railing.&nbsp; It is always tolerably well filled, and on 
Saturday nights it is overflowing.&nbsp; Here are confined those against 
whom there is no serious charge; persons arrested for drunkenness, or for 
simple disorder on the streets.&nbsp; On Sunday morning the visitor will 
sometimes find a large crowd of men collected in it, not all of whom are 
unfortunates or criminals.&nbsp; Some are well-dressed, well-to-do persons,
who have had the misfortune to be drunk and noisy on Saturday night.&nbsp; 
Some are strangers, residents of other cities, who have started out from 
their hotels to see the sights and have a merry time, and who have fallen 
at length&mdash;and fortunately for them&mdash;into the hands <!-- page 
238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>of the 
police.&nbsp; A few are persons who have been wrongfully or maliciously 
accused of crime.</p>
<p>From sunset until long after midnight on Saturday, the police are busy 
with ridding the streets of drunken and disorderly persons.&nbsp; As soon 
as a person is arrested, he is taken to the Tombs or to one of the 
station-houses.&nbsp; It is the duty of the officer in charge of the 
precinct to lock up every one against whom a definite charge is 
brought.&nbsp; Even though satisfied that the person is wrongfully accused,
or is simply unfortunate, he has no discretion.&nbsp; He must hold for 
trial all charged with offences, and at the Tombs the officer is obliged to
throw persons who command his sympathy into the company of the most 
abandoned wretches for an entire night.&nbsp; Drunkenness, disorderly 
conduct, and fighting, are the principal charges brought against the 
occupants of the Bummers&rsquo; Cell.&nbsp; The noise, profanity, and 
obscenity are fearful.&nbsp; All classes and ages are represented 
there.</p>
<p>During the year 1870, 49,423 persons were confined for various periods 
of time in the Tombs.</p>
<p>The Tombs Police Court offers some interesting and instructive 
spectacles.&nbsp; It is opened at six o&rsquo;clock on Sunday 
morning.&nbsp; It is presided over by Justice Joseph Dowling, a short, 
thickset man, with a handsome face, and a full, well-shaped head, 
indicating both ability and determination.&nbsp; Judge Dowling is still a 
young man, and is one of the most efficient magistrates in the city.&nbsp; 
His decisions are quickly rendered, and are usually just.&nbsp; His long 
experience with criminals has given him an intimate knowledge of the men 
with whom he has to deal, and their ways.&nbsp; This often helps him to a 
conclusion which is really true, although the evidence in the case does not
confirm it, and he frequently startles criminals by boldly declaring that 
they did thus and so at such a time.&nbsp; The criminal overwhelmed with 
astonishment and confusion generally admits the charge, and is sentenced 
accordingly.&nbsp; A stranger is at once struck with the quick and 
penetrating power of Judge Dowling&rsquo;s glance.&nbsp; He seems to look 
right through a criminal, and persons brought before him generally find it 
impossible to deceive him.&nbsp; This <!-- page 239--><a 
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>has made him the 
terror of criminals, who have come to regard an arraignment before him as 
equivalent to a conviction, which is generally the case.&nbsp; At the same 
time he is kind and considerate to those who are simply unfortunate.&nbsp; 
As a man, he is kind-hearted, and inclined to lean toward the side of 
mercy.</p>
<p>As soon as the court is opened, the prisoners are called up in the order
of their arrival during the previous night.&nbsp; Drunkenness and disorder,
and first offences of a minor character, are punished with a reprimand, and
the prisoner is dismissed.&nbsp; These cases constitute a majority of the 
charges, and the judge disposes of them with a rapidity which astonishes a 
stranger.&nbsp; The more serious cases are held for further examination, or
are sent on for trial before the Court of Special Sessions.</p>
<p>All classes of people come to the Justice with complaints of every 
description.&nbsp; Women come to complain of their husbands, and men of 
their wives.&nbsp; Judge Dowling listens to them all, and if a remedy is 
needed, applies the proper one without delay.&nbsp; In most instances he 
dismisses the parties with good advice, as their cases are not provided for
by the law.</p>
<p>The Court of Special Sessions sits in a large hall on the right of the 
main entrance to the prison.&nbsp; It is strictly a criminal court, and is 
for the trial of charges which are too serious to be disposed of in the 
Police Court.&nbsp; Two judges are supposed to sit during the sessions of 
this court, but Judge Dowling frequently conducts its business alone.&nbsp;
The prisoner is allowed to employ counsel and introduce witnesses in his 
own behalf.</p>
<p>The following is an example of the way in which Judge Dowling transacts 
business in this court:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first case of importance was that of the People vs. James 
Day, <i>alias</i> &lsquo;Big-mouthed Scotty,&rsquo; and William Jones, 
<i>alias</i> &lsquo;Billy Clews,&rsquo; on the complaint of Captain Ira S. 
Garland, of the Twelfth precinct.&nbsp; Probably there are not two other 
men in this city who could fairly be compared with these.&nbsp; They are 
both of the most dissolute, desperate habits, and have been what they now 
are, thieves, since the date of their entry into this city.&nbsp; The 
first, who is truthfully styled &lsquo;big-mouthed&rsquo;&mdash;that hole 
in his face being almost large enough to run in one of <!-- page 240--><a 
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>the cars on the 
elevated railroad in Greenwich street&mdash;was born in the Hielands 
o&rsquo; Bonnie Scotland; but, be it said, he appears not to have become 
inoculated with the same spirit of honesty and perseverance that 
characterizes the greater portion of his countrymen.&nbsp; He arrived here 
nearly twenty years ago, and since that time he has been a lazy, 
contemptible thief, a shocking contrast with Caledonians in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p240.jpg">
<img alt="COURT OF SPECIAL SESSIONS." src="images/p240.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;His companion, &lsquo;Billy Clews,&rsquo; has been known in 
different circles of the same profession, and could usually be found in the
neighborhood of Five Points.&nbsp; On Thursday there was what is usually 
termed a &lsquo;large&rsquo; funeral, from a church at the corner of 
One-hundred-and-twenty-sixth street and Fourth avenue.&nbsp; Outside was a 
long line of coaches, and inside the church was full of mourners and the 
friends of the departed, whose remains were about to be consigned to that 
&lsquo;bourn whence no traveller returns.&rsquo;&nbsp; The crowd inside was
so great that the police were called in to put the people in the seats, as 
far as could be done, and remained there during the service to keep 
order.&nbsp; While Captain Garland was standing at the top of the centre 
aisle he saw &lsquo;Big-Mouth&rsquo; elbowing his way from the altar 
towards the door, and making various efforts to pick pockets as he came 
along.&nbsp; Presently he <!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>came close up behind a lady who was standing 
with her face to the altar, and, reaching his hands in the folds of her 
dress, quietly withdrew her pocket-book from its hiding place.&nbsp; The 
pocket-book vanished very quickly, however, so that the captain could not 
see which way it went or what, for the time, had become of it.&nbsp; At 
first the thieves did not observe the captain, but the instant Day caught a
glance of him he turned quietly to his accomplice and said &lsquo;Look out,
Billy; there&rsquo;s a big cop.&rsquo;&nbsp; Billy took the 
&lsquo;cue,&rsquo; began to move off, and attempted to get out of the 
church.&nbsp; But as they were both in the doorway, and seeing the captain 
making for them, they made a rush out from the sacred edifice, passed the 
carriages and ran down the avenue as fast as &lsquo;shank&rsquo;s 
pony&rsquo; could carry them.&nbsp; The captain gave chase, and, with the 
aid of an officer on duty at the church, succeeded in arresting the 
individuals who were thus trading on the mourners over a dead body.&nbsp; 
On returning to the church Garland was informed of the loss of the 
lady&rsquo;s pocketbook, but he failed to discover her among the crowd, and
consequently could not produce her in evidence against the prisoners at the
bar.&nbsp; He had seen them previously walking towards the church, and 
knowing Day to be a general thief, he gave orders to look out for them, but
somehow for a long time the thieves escaped the vigilance of the 
officers.&nbsp; They allowed it was &lsquo;all wrong&rsquo; to be in the 
church at the time, but they told the captain he ought to allow them to go,
for he knew &lsquo;how it was&rsquo; with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What have you to say, Scotty?&rsquo; asked the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, well,&rsquo; replied Big-Mouth, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t 
thenk a&rsquo;ve got much to say, only to ask your Honor to deal mercifully
with us.&nbsp; The captain at the police station didn&rsquo;t say he was to
breng this prosecution agen us noo; he only told us he wud tak us out 
o&rsquo; harum&rsquo;s way, and didn&rsquo;t make no charge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judge Dowling.&mdash;&lsquo;It is no use my saying anything to 
you, Day; in fact, all that could be said is that you have never been 
anything else than what you are now, a thief, and that, too, of a most 
contemptible type.&nbsp; You go about to the various graveyards and rob the
poor persons who are too absorbed in interring <!-- page 242--><a 
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>the dead and in 
grieving for their lost friends to notice that you are there for the 
purpose of plunder; you also visit the churches wherever there is a crowd 
of this sort paying their last respects to the remains of a friend, and 
never leave without robbing some poor persons of their money or 
jewelry.&nbsp; Scotchy, you have done that business for the past eighteen 
years to my own knowledge.&nbsp; I do not know so much about your 
accomplice, or how long he has been travelling with you.&nbsp; I will, 
however, rid the people of your presence, and do my best to stay your 
heartless proceedings for some time to come.&nbsp; One year each in the 
Penitentiary and a fine of $200 each, and both to stand committed until the
amounts be paid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I told you how it &rsquo;oud be, Scotty,&rsquo; yelled his
partner, and with a deplorable attitude the pair were marched over the 
&lsquo;Bridge of Sighs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tombs is merely a prison of detention, and as soon as prisoners are 
sentenced to the institutions on Blackwell&rsquo;s Island, or the State 
Prison, they are conveyed to those establishments with as little delay as 
possible.&nbsp; The vehicle used for transporting them through the city is 
a close wagon, with wooden blinds for light and ventilation, around the 
upper part of the sides.&nbsp; This is known as &ldquo;Black Maria,&rdquo; 
and may be daily seen rumbling through the city on its way from the Police 
Courts to the ferry to Blackwell&rsquo;s Island.</p>
<p>Closely connected with the penal system of the city is the &ldquo;Prison
Association of New York.&rdquo;&nbsp; This society was organized in 
1844.&nbsp; Its constitution declares that its objects are: &ldquo;I.&nbsp;
A humane attention to persons arrested and held for examination or trial, 
including inquiry into the circumstances of their arrest, and the crimes 
charged against them; securing to the friendless an impartial trial, and 
protection from the depredations of unprincipled persons, whether 
professional sharpers or fellow-prisoners.&nbsp; II.&nbsp; Encouragement 
and aid to discharged convicts in their efforts to reform and earn an 
honest living.&nbsp; This is done by assisting them to situations, 
providing them with tools, and otherwise counselling them and helping them 
to business.&nbsp; III.&nbsp; To study the question of prison discipline 
<!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
243</span>generally, the government of the State, County, and City prisons,
to obtain statistics of crime, to disseminate information on this subject, 
to evolve the true principles of science, and impress a more reformatory 
character on our penitentiary system.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p243.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;BLACK MARIA.&rdquo;" src="images/p243.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Between 1844 and 1869, the members and agents of the Association visited
in the prisons of New York and Brooklyn 93,560 persons confined 
there.&nbsp; These were poor and friendless prisoners, and they received 
from the Association such advice and aid as their cases demanded.&nbsp; 
During the same period, 25,290 additional cases were examined by the 
officers of the Society.&nbsp; They succeeded in obtaining the withdrawal 
of 6148 complaints, as being trivial, or based upon prejudice or 
passion.&nbsp; Upon their recommendation, the courts discharged 7922 
persons guilty of first offences, and who were penitent, or who had 
committed the offence under mitigating circumstances.&nbsp; They also 
provided 4130 discharged convicts with permanent situations, and furnished 
18,307 other discharged convicts with board, money, railroad tickets, or 
clothing, to help them to better their condition.&nbsp; In the twenty-five 
years embraced in the above period, they thus extended their good offices 
to 156,368 persons.&nbsp; A noble record, truly.</p>

<h3>I.&nbsp; THE DAILY JOURNALS.</h3>
<p>The Metropolitan Press is the model after which the journals of the 
entire country are shaped, and, taken as a whole, it is the best 
institution of its kind in existence.&nbsp; The leading New York journals 
have but one superior in the whole world&mdash;the London 
<i>Times</i>&mdash;and they frequently equal, though they do not surpass 
the &ldquo;Thunderer&rdquo; itself in the extent and importance of their 
news, and the ability and value of their editorials.&nbsp; They are the 
best managed, employ the greatest talent, and are the most influential upon
the country at large of any American newspapers.</p>
<p>The leading journals are the morning papers.&nbsp; Five of these, the 
<i>Herald</i>, <i>Tribune</i>, <i>Times</i>, <i>World</i>, and <i>Staats 
Zeitung</i>, are huge eight-page sheets, and frequently issue supplements 
of from four to eight pages additional.&nbsp; The others consist of four 
large, old-fashioned pages.</p>
<p>The expense and labor of issuing a first-class morning journal are very 
great.&nbsp; The cost of publication ranges from $800,000 to $1,000,000 per
annum; and the force employed, including editors, reporters, proof-readers,
newsmen, pressmen, feeders, clerks and compositors, is over four hundred 
persons.&nbsp; The profits vary according to the paper and the times.</p>
<p>The <i>Herald</i> is private property, as are some of the others.&nbsp; 
The <i>Tribune</i>, <i>Times</i>, and <i>Sun</i>, are owned by stock 
companies.&nbsp; Under Mr. Raymond the <i>Times</i> was subject to his sole
<!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
245</span>direction, but the <i>Tribune</i> has always suffered from the 
interference of the stockholders.</p>
<p>Each newspaper has its editor in chief, who controls the general tone 
and policy of the paper.&nbsp; He decides all matters relating to its 
editorial conduct, and is known to the public as the responsible 
editor.&nbsp; His principal assistant is the managing editor.&nbsp; In the 
absence of the chief editor he is the controlling power of the 
journal.&nbsp; His legitimate duties are to oversee the details of the 
paper, to see that its publication is not delayed, to engage and dismiss 
sub-editors and correspondents, to prescribe the character of the service 
required of these gentlemen, and to regulate the salaries paid to 
them.&nbsp; All the writers on the paper are directly responsible to him, 
and he, in his turn, to the chief editor.&nbsp; There is also a night 
editor, whose duties are heavy and responsible.&nbsp; He is charged with 
the duty of &ldquo;making up&rdquo; the paper, and decides what shall and 
what shall not go in&mdash;a delicate duty sometimes.&nbsp; He is at his 
post at 7 o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and remains there until the paper 
goes to press in the morning, which is generally between 2 and 3 
o&rsquo;clock, though sometimes it is held back by important news until 
daylight.&nbsp; The foreign editor is usually a foreigner, and one well 
acquainted with the leading languages of Europe.&nbsp; He controls the 
foreign correspondence, and writes editorials upon European topics.&nbsp; 
The financial editor writes the money article, and is quite an important 
personage.&nbsp; He is obliged to be well informed concerning all the 
financial transactions of the day; he is courted by bankers and 
capitalists, as he to a certain extent controls public opinion in money 
matters, and he has ample facilities for making money outside of his 
position.&nbsp; The post is considered one of the most lucrative on the 
paper, and the salary is regarded as a minor consideration.&nbsp; The city 
editor has charge of the city news, and is the chief of the 
reporters.&nbsp; The leading dailies have from twelve to thirty 
reporters.&nbsp; These are assigned to duty each day by the city editor, 
who enters his directions to them in a large book.&nbsp; They are sometimes
required to go to certain places to obtain news, and are expected to 
furnish so much matter concerning it.&nbsp; Some of the reporters have 
special lines of <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>duty, and report nothing but law cases, police
matters, etc., and some limit their operations to Brooklyn, Jersey City, 
and the other suburban towns.&nbsp; Some of the reporters are stenographers
also.&nbsp; At times there will be scarcely any work to be done, and again 
the powers of the whole staff of reporters will be severely taxed.&nbsp; 
There are also a literary editor, whose duties are to review and notice 
books and other publications; and art, dramatic and musical critics.&nbsp; 
Some of these are, as they should be, gentlemen of the highest culture, and
impartial in their opinions.&nbsp; Others are quite the reverse.&nbsp; The 
best of them, however, are but men, though they too often assume to be 
something superior, and their judgments are not infallible.&nbsp; The 
leading journals also employ translators, who put into English such 
extracts as it may be necessary to use from the foreign papers.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The amount of labor thus expended upon a morning <!-- page 247--><a 
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>newspaper is 
immense.&nbsp; It is followed by an almost equal outlay of mechanical work 
in putting the paper in type and printing it.&nbsp; The principal papers 
are stereotyped, and are printed from plates.&nbsp; Formerly the Eight and 
Ten Cylinder Hoe Presses were used, but of late years the Bullock Press has
become very popular.&nbsp; It works quite as rapidly as the Hoe press, 
prints on both sides at once, and is said to spoil fewer sheets.&nbsp; The 
paper is put in in a large roll, and is cut by the machine into the proper 
sizes and printed.&nbsp; Only one feeder is necessary.</p>
<p>Nearly all the city newspapers are located in or around Printing House 
Square, immediately opposite and east of the City Hall.&nbsp; One of the 
greatest curiosities of this square is a huge engine, which runs a large 
number of presses.&nbsp; It is situated in Spruce street, between William 
and Nassau streets, and occupies the basement of the building in which it 
is located.&nbsp; There are two engines here&mdash;one of 150 horse power, 
which is used during the day, and a smaller one of 75 horse power, which 
relieves it at night.&nbsp; Shafting and belting carry the power in every 
direction from the engine.&nbsp; One hundred and twenty-five presses are 
worked by these engines&mdash;each being estimated at so much horse power, 
and charged accordingly.&nbsp; They turn three-quarters of a mile of main 
shafting, besides a mile or more of connecting shafts, and as much 
belting.&nbsp; One of these belts, an India rubber one, 120 feet long, 
connects a fifth story press on Nassau street with the main shafting on 
Spruce street, across the intervening yards, and another of leather, on 
Beekman street, 140 feet, perfectly perpendicular, connects the sub-cellar 
and the attic.&nbsp; Some of the shafting passes under and across the 
streets.&nbsp; Over fifty newspapers and literary papers, besides magazines
and books innumerable, are printed by this monster engine.</p>
<p>The salaries paid by the newspapers are not large.&nbsp; Those who 
receive what is seemingly high pay do an amount of work out of proportion 
to their compensation.&nbsp; Mr. Greeley receives $10,000 per annum.&nbsp; 
Mr. Reid, the managing editor of the <i>Tribune</i>, receives $5000.&nbsp; 
Mr. Sinclair, the publisher, receives $10,000.&nbsp; These are considered 
good salaries.&nbsp; Any one familiar <!-- page 248--><a 
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>with the cost of 
living in New York will not think them very much in excess of the wants of 
their recipients, who are men with families.</p>
<p>As a newspaper, the <i>New York Herald</i> stands at the head of the 
city dailies.&nbsp; It aims to be a vehicle for imparting the latest news 
of the day, and as such it is a great success.&nbsp; Nobody cares for its 
opinions editorially expressed, for it is the general belief that the 
<i>Herald</i> has no fixed opinions.&nbsp; It is valued here simply as a 
newspaper.&nbsp; It is beyond a doubt the most energetic, and the best 
managed <i>newspaper</i> in the city.&nbsp; Mr. James Gordon Bennett, the 
elder, has no rival in the art of conducting a popular journal, but his 
son, Mr. J. G. Bennett, jr., does not seem to inherit his father&rsquo;s 
ability.&nbsp; Young Mr. Bennett is now the managing editor, and since his 
accession to that post there has been a marked decline in the ability of 
the paper, which, under the rule of Mr. Hudson, was unquestioned.&nbsp; 
Nobody expects consistency in the <i>Herald</i>, and its course to-day is 
no guarantee that it will hold the same tone to-morrow.&nbsp; Mr. Bennett 
aims to float with the popular current, to be always on the winning side, 
and he succeeds.&nbsp; The advertising patronage of the paper is 
immense.</p>
<p>The <i>Herald</i> office is one of the most conspicuous buildings in the
city.&nbsp; It is located at the corner of Broadway and Ann street, and is 
built of white marble, in the modern French style.&nbsp; Below the sidewalk
are two immense cellars or vaults, one below the other, in which are two 
steam engines of thirty-five horse power each.&nbsp; Three immense Hoe 
presses are kept running constantly from midnight until seven in the 
morning, printing the daily edition.&nbsp; The rooms and machinery are kept
in the most perfect order.&nbsp; Nothing is allowed to be out of place, and
the slightest speck of dirt visible in any part, calls forth a sharp rebuke
from Mr. Bennett, who makes frequent visits to every department of the 
paper.&nbsp; On the street floor, the main room is the public office of the
journal.&nbsp; Its entrances are on Broadway and Ann street.&nbsp; It is 
paved with marble tiles, and the desks, counters, racks, etc., are of solid
black walnut, ornamented with plate glass.&nbsp; Every thing is <!-- page 
249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>scrupulously
clean, and the room presents the appearance of some wealthy banking 
office.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p249.jpg">
<img alt="THE HERALD OFFICE." src="images/p249.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On the third floor are the editorial rooms.&nbsp; The principal 
apartment is the &ldquo;Council Room,&rdquo; which overlooks 
Broadway.&nbsp; Every other branch of the editorial department has its 
separate room, and all are furnished with every convenience necessary for 
doing their work with the utmost precision and dispatch.&nbsp; Each day, at
noon, the editors of the <i>Herald</i>, twelve in number, assemble in the 
&ldquo;Council Room.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bennett, if he is in the city, takes 
his seat at the head of the table, and the others assume the places 
assigned.&nbsp; If Mr. Bennett is not present, his son, James Gordon 
Bennett, jr., presides at the council, and in the absence of both father 
and son, <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
250</span>the managing editor takes the head of the table.&nbsp; The 
council is opened by Mr. Bennett, or his representative, who presents a 
list of subjects.&nbsp; These are taken up, <i>seriatim</i>, and discussed 
by all present.&nbsp; The topics to be presented in the editorial columns 
of the <i>Herald</i> the next day are determined upon, and each editor is 
assigned the subject he is to &ldquo;write up.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this is 
determined in a short while.&nbsp; Then Mr. Bennett asks the gentlemen 
present for suggestions.&nbsp; He listens attentively to each one, and 
decides quickly whether they shall be presented in the <i>Herald</i>, and 
at what time; and if he desires any subject to be written upon, he states 
his wish, and &ldquo;sketches,&rdquo; in his peculiar and decisive manner, 
the various headings and the style of treatment.&nbsp; There are twelve 
editors and thirty-five reporters employed on the <i>Herald</i>.&nbsp; They
are liberally paid for their services.&nbsp; Any one bringing in news is 
well rewarded for his trouble.&nbsp; The composing rooms are located on the
top floor, and are spacious, airy, and excellently lighted.&nbsp; A 
&ldquo;dumb waiter,&rdquo; or vertical railway, communicates with the press
room; and speaking tubes, and a smaller &ldquo;railway,&rdquo; afford the 
means of conversation and transmitting small parcels between this room and 
the various parts of the building.&nbsp; Five hundred men are employed in 
the various departments of the paper.</p>
<p>The circulation of the daily edition of the <i>Herald</i> is estimated 
by competent judges at from 65,000 to 70,000 copies.&nbsp; In times of 
great public excitement, all the dailies overrun their usual number by many
thousands.</p>
<p>The <i>Tribune</i> has a daily circulation of about 43,000 copies.&nbsp;
It is, in point of ability, the best of the city dailies.&nbsp; It long ago
surmounted its early difficulties, and has been for many years one of the 
most profitable enterprises in the city.&nbsp; It is owned by a joint stock
company.&nbsp; It was begun by Mr. Greeley on $1000 of borrowed 
money.&nbsp; At the formation of the company the stock was divided into 100
shares at $1000 each.&nbsp; The number is still the same, but the shares 
could not now be bought for many times their original value.&nbsp; In 1870 
the dividend declared amounted to $163,000; or, $1630 on each share.&nbsp; 
At present the shares are owned as follows:</p>

<p>The <i>Tribune</i> property is valued at over $1,000,000, which includes
nearly $300,000 in real estate.&nbsp; The stockholders, it is said, 
contemplate, at no distant day, erecting a large and handsome printing 
office on the site of the present unpretending building now occupied.&nbsp;
The profits of the paper do not depend upon the daily edition.&nbsp; The 
semi-weekly circulates about 35,000 or 40,000 copies, and the weekly about 
130,000 copies.&nbsp; The last is sent all over the United States, and has 
beyond a doubt the largest number of readers of any paper in the world.</p>
<p>The <i>Tribune</i> is the leading organ of the Republican party in the 
United States, and its influence is tremendous.&nbsp; It is a well written,
well conducted paper, and is every year becoming more independent of party 
control.&nbsp; The chief editor is Horace Greeley, who imparts his strong 
personality to the whole journal.&nbsp; Many of the country people believe 
that the Philosopher writes every line on the editorial page.&nbsp; The 
managing editor is Whitelaw Reid, and the publisher Samuel Sinclair.&nbsp; 
Mr. Reid succeeded Mr. John Russell Young, and the paper has profited by 
the change.&nbsp; Mr. Sinclair is one of the most efficient publishers in 
the land, and the <i>Tribune</i> owes not a little of its success to his 
genius&mdash;for that is the only name to give it.&nbsp; The <!-- page 
252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>editorial 
staff comprises more ability than that of any other city journal, though 
some of the others make a better use of the talent at their disposal.&nbsp;
Its correspondence, both domestic and foreign, is the best of all the city 
papers&mdash;perhaps the best in the Union&mdash;and the list of its 
correspondents contains some of the brightest names in literature.</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i> is also a Republican journal, and aims to represent the
Administration of General Grant.&nbsp; Under the management of the late 
Henry J. Raymond, a born journalist, it was a power in the land.&nbsp; 
Since Mr. Raymond&rsquo;s death there has been a falling off in the 
ability, the manliness, and the influence of the paper.&nbsp; It is owned 
by a stock company, and is a profitable enterprise.&nbsp; The chief editor 
is Mr. Louis Jennings, an Englishman, and formerly the New York 
correspondent of the London <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Jennings is a gentleman
of ability and culture, and a journalist of considerable experience.&nbsp; 
His chief needs are a decided infusion of American ideas and sentiment, and
a recognition of the dissimilarity between the London and New York mode of 
viewing matters.&nbsp; The publisher is Mr. George Jones.</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i>, under Mr. Raymond, was one of the freshest and most 
thoroughly up to the times journals on the continent.&nbsp; Its 
correspondence, especially that from Europe, was exceptionally good.&nbsp; 
There has been a falling off in this respect of late.&nbsp; The circulation
of the paper is not known with certainty, but is believed to be about 
30,000 or 35,000 copies.</p>
<p>The <i>World</i> is the principal Democratic journal of the city, and 
aspires to be the organ of the party throughout the country.&nbsp; It was 
begun about the year 1859 as a religious paper, and is said to have sunk 
about $300,000 for its projectors.&nbsp; It then became the organ of the 
Democracy of the city, and has for some time paid well.&nbsp; It is the 
property of its editor, Mr. Manton G. Marble.&nbsp; It is unquestionably 
one of the ablest journals in the country.&nbsp; Its editorials are well 
written, indicative of deep thought on the subjects treated of, and 
gentlemanly in tone.&nbsp; In literary excellence, it is not surpassed by 
any city journal.&nbsp; It aims to be in the front rank of the march of 
ideas, and makes a <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>feature of discussions of the leading 
scientific and social questions of the day.&nbsp; It is lightened by a 
brilliant display of wit, and the &ldquo;Funny Man of the World&rdquo; is 
well known in the city.&nbsp; The chief editor is Manton G. Marble.&nbsp; 
He is the author of the majority of the leaders.&nbsp; In this he is ably 
seconded by Mr. Chamberlain, one of the most forcible and successful 
writers on the city press.&nbsp; Mr. Marble is not seen much in the 
office.&nbsp; The <i>World</i> rooms are connected with his residence in 
the upper part of the city, by a private telegraph, by means of which he 
exercises a constant supervision over the paper.&nbsp; The managing editor 
is Mr. David G. Croly (the husband of &ldquo;Jennie June&rdquo;).&nbsp; He 
is a genius in his way.&nbsp; He does not write much, but gives the greater
part of the time to superintending the work of the office.&nbsp; He is said
to be extremely fertile in suggesting themes for treatment to his brother 
editors.&nbsp; The great faults of the <i>World</i> are its devotion to 
sensation journalism, its thick and thin Roman Catholic partizanism, and, 
strange to say, a little too much looseness in the tone of its Sunday 
edition.&nbsp; Its circulation is variously estimated at from 15,000 to 
30,000.&nbsp; The exact number is known only to the publisher.</p>
<p>The <i>Sun</i> assumes to be the organ of the working classes, and 
claims a circulation of 85,000 copies.&nbsp; It is a bright, sparkling 
journal, issued at a cost of two cents.&nbsp; It is four pages in size, and
has a fine list of advertisements.&nbsp; It is owned by a stock company, 
who bought it from the late Moses Y. Beach, its founder.&nbsp; The chief 
editor is Mr. Charles A. Dana, a journalist of long experience, and one of 
the most thoroughly cultivated men in the profession.&nbsp; He has made it 
a great success.&nbsp; It is piquant, forcible, and good-natured.&nbsp; Mr.
Dana is assisted by a corps of able editorial writers and reporters, who 
are thoroughly impressed with the wisdom of his policy.&nbsp; He is very 
sanguine of making a still greater success of the Sun, and claims that he 
will yet run its circulation up to 200,000 copies.</p>
<p>The <i>Standard</i> is the property of Mr. John Russell Young, formerly 
the managing editor of the <i>Tribune</i>.&nbsp; It is a Republican organ, 
and is struggling to reach an established and <!-- page 254--><a 
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>prosperous 
position.&nbsp; It is well managed, and is conducted with considerable 
editorial ability.</p>
<p>The <i>Journal of Commerce</i> is one of the few old-style papers left 
in New York.&nbsp; It is a ponderous four-page sheet, depending more upon 
its advertising than upon its circulation for its profits.&nbsp; It is 
edited with ability, and as it employs but few editors and reporters, and 
cares but little for general news, its publication is inexpensive.&nbsp; It
is supplied by a regular carrier, and is not sold on the news-stands.&nbsp;
It is taken by the leading hotels and by the down-town merchants, to whom 
it is valuable because of its commercial reports.&nbsp; The general reader 
would find it dull reading.&nbsp; It is one of the best paying papers in 
the city.</p>
<p>The <i>Star</i> is a two cent paper, and was started at the time of the 
sale of the <i>Sun</i> to Mr. Dana and his associates, with the hope of 
securing the patronage of the working classes.&nbsp; Its managing editor is
Mr. Joseph Howard.&nbsp; It is a sprightly paper, intensely Democratic in 
tone, and is said to be prosperous.</p>
<p>The evening papers are much less influential than the morning journals, 
but the best of them are very successful.</p>
<p>The <i>Evening Post</i> heads the list.&nbsp; It is owned by William 
Cullen Bryant &amp; Co., and Mr. Bryant is the principal editor.&nbsp; It 
is the ablest and the most influential of all the evening papers, and is 
one of the purest in its tone of any of the American journals.&nbsp; It is 
taken chiefly in the families of cultivated and professional men.&nbsp; Its
book notices are considered the most reliable.&nbsp; Its circulation and 
advertising patronage are large, and it is a very profitable 
investment.</p>
<p>The <i>Commercial Advertiser</i> is now under the control of the 
venerable Thurlow Weed, and is a good paper.</p>
<p>The <i>Evening Express</i> is the property of the brothers James and 
Erastus Brooks.&nbsp; It is well managed, and well edited, and is regarded 
as ranking next to the <i>Post</i> in ability and general excellence.&nbsp;
It is said to be worth $40,000 per annum above expenses to its 
proprietors.</p>
<p>The <i>Evening Mail</i> is younger than either of the others, but not 
far behind the best of them in ability and interest.&nbsp; It has a decided
literary tone, and is one of the most enterprising <!-- page 255--><a 
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>news purveyors in the
city.&nbsp; It is now a thoroughly successful enterprise, and it deserves 
its good fortune.</p>
<p>The <i>Telegram</i> is little more than an evening edition of the 
Herald.&nbsp; It is owned by James Gordon Bennett, jr., and is a lively 
sheet, full of news and gossip.&nbsp; It sells for two cents, and has a 
large circulation.&nbsp; Its first page always contains a rough, but 
sometimes spirited cartoon, caricaturing some notable event of the 
day.&nbsp; It is a paying paper.</p>
<p>The <i>Evening News</i> is a penny paper.&nbsp; It claims to have the 
largest circulation in the city, and is said to be very profitable.&nbsp; 
It is devoted almost exclusively to police news, and descriptions of crime,
and finds its readers chiefly among the lower and rougher portion of the 
community.&nbsp; It is owned and conducted by Mr. Benjamin Wood.</p>
<p>The evening papers are generally issued in four editions, at one, two, 
four and five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; On occasions of unusual
interest, they often issue extras every hour until late in the night.&nbsp;
The evening papers contain the latest news and gossip, and a variety of 
light and entertaining reading matter, and are bought chiefly by persons 
who wish to read them at home after the cares and fatigues of the day are 
over, or to kill time in the cars on their way home.</p>
<p>There are three daily morning papers published in the German language, 
the <i>State Gazette</i>, the <i>Democrat</i>, and the <i>Journal</i>, and 
one evening paper, the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Courier of the United 
States</i>, and <i>Franco-American Messenger</i>, are issued in the French 
language.&nbsp; They are also daily morning papers.&nbsp; All are well 
supported by the citizens speaking the language they use.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; WEEKLY PRESS.</h3>
<p>Exclusive of the weekly editions of the daily journals, there are about 
133 weekly papers published in the city of New York.&nbsp; Some of these 
are literary journals, some political, some <!-- page 256--><a 
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>the organs of the 
various religious bodies, and some devoted to the interests of trade and 
manufactures.</p>
<p>The best known weeklies are the literary, religious, and political 
papers, and of these the most noted are, <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>, 
<i>Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar</i>, <i>Frank Leslie&rsquo;s Illustrated 
Newspaper</i>, the <i>Nation</i>, the <i>Chimney Corner</i>, the 
<i>Ledger</i>, <i>Home Journal</i>, <i>Weekly Review</i>, <i>Sunday 
Mercury</i>, <i>New York Weekly</i>, <i>Hearth and Home</i>, the<i> Sunday 
News</i>, the<i> Albion</i>, <i>Dispatch</i>, <i>Sunday Times</i>, 
<i>Citizen</i>, <i>Revolution</i>, <i>Spirit of the Times</i>, and 
<i>Police Gazette</i>, among the secular papers.&nbsp; The most prominent 
religious journals are the <i>Independent</i>, <i>Examiner</i>, 
<i>Evangelist</i>, <i>Methodist</i>, <i>Observer</i>, <i>Tablet</i>, 
<i>Liberal Christian</i>, <i>Christian Advocate</i>, <i>Christian 
Union</i>, <i>Christian Inquirer</i>, and <i>Church Journal</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Ledger</i> has the largest circulation, having an actual sale of 
300,000 copies per week.&nbsp; It is so well known throughout the country 
that it would be superfluous to describe it here.&nbsp; It is the property 
of Mr. Robert Bonner, who has reaped a large fortune from it.&nbsp; Next in
popularity is the <i>New York Weekly</i>, which is much inferior to the 
<i>Ledger</i>, but which claims a circulation of over 200,000 copies.&nbsp;
There are about a dozen illustrated papers of various degrees of merit, 
<i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>, the <i>Bazaar</i>, and <i>Frank 
Leslie&rsquo;s Illustrated Newspaper</i> head the list in popularity and 
worth.&nbsp; The first and second claim a circulation of over one hundred 
thousand, and Frank Leslie claims about seventy-five thousand for his 
paper.&nbsp; Some of the other illustrated journals are simply indecent 
sheets, and should be suppressed.&nbsp; The <i>Nation</i> is regarded as 
the highest critical authority in the country, and holds here very much the
position of the <i>Saturday Review</i> in London.</p>
<p>The literary journals are well conducted, and one will often find 
articles of genuine merit in some of the most unpretending.&nbsp; The 
reason is that journalists are unable to live on their salaries, as a rule,
if they be married men, and are forced to make up the deficiency by 
contributing to the magazines and weekly papers.&nbsp; As a matter of 
course, they must dispose of their wares wherever there is a market, and 
where they are sure of being paid, even at starvation rates, for their 
labors.&nbsp; From $2.50 to $5.00 per <!-- page 257--><a 
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>column is the rate of
payment with the most of the weeklies, and many men and women with whose 
names and labors the literary world is familiar, are glad to write for them
at this beggarly price as a means of increasing their legitimate 
incomes.&nbsp; The number of writers is very much in excess of the demand, 
and literature offers a thorny road to the majority of its followers in the
metropolis.</p>
<p>The Sunday papers are generally high priced and nasty.&nbsp; They are 
entirely sensational in character, and are devoted to a class of news and 
literature which can hardly be termed healthy.&nbsp; They revel in detailed
descriptions of subjects which are rigorously excluded from the daily 
papers, and abound in questionable advertisements.&nbsp; All of which they 
offer for Sabbath reading; and the reader would be startled to see into how
many reputable households these dirty sheets find their way.</p>

258</span>XV.&nbsp; WALL STREET.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE STREET.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Wall Street</span> begins on the east side of 
Broadway, opposite Trinity Church, and terminates at the East River.&nbsp; 
It is about half a mile from the extreme southern end of the island, and 
about the same distance from the City Hall.&nbsp; It is a narrow street, 
about fifty feet in width, and slopes gradually from Broadway to the 
river.&nbsp; It is lined on both sides with handsome brown stone, yellow 
stone, granite, marble, iron, and brick buildings, and the Treasury and 
Custom-House rear their magnificent fronts about midway between the termini
of the street.&nbsp; They are diagonally opposite each other.&nbsp; The 
buildings are covered with a multiplicity of signs, rivalling the edifices 
of Nassau street, in this respect.&nbsp; Scarcely a house has less than a 
score of offices within its walls, and some contain at least three times as
many.&nbsp; Space is valuable, and rents are high in Wall street, and many 
of the leading firms in it have to content themselves with small, dark 
apartments, which a conscientious man would hesitate to call an 
&ldquo;office.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rents paid for such quarters are enormous, 
and the buildings yield their owners large incomes every year.&nbsp; The 
streets running into Wall street, on the right and left, are also occupied 
for several blocks with the offices of bankers and brokers, and are all 
included in the general term &ldquo;Wall street,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The 
Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p259.jpg">
<img alt="WALL STREET." src="images/p259.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Wall street first appears in the history of the city as a portion of a 
sheep pasture which was used in common by the inhabitants <!-- page 
259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>of New 
Amsterdam.&nbsp; Its natural condition was partly rolling upland and partly
meadow of a swampy character.&nbsp; The name of the street originated thus:
About the middle of the seventeenth century, the English in the New England
colonies began to press heavily upon the Dutch in New Netherlands, and kept
the worthy burghers of New Amsterdam in a constant dread of an 
invasion.&nbsp; Influenced by this feeling, the city authorities resolved 
to fortify the place, and in 1653 constructed a wall or stockade across the
island, from river to river just beyond the line of the village.&nbsp; This
wall passed directly across the old sheep pasture.&nbsp; Citizens were 
forbidden to build within 100 feet of the stockade, this open space being 
reserved for the movements of troops.&nbsp; It soon became a prominent 
highway, and the eastern portion has since remained so.&nbsp; The 
anticipated attack on the city was not made, but the wall was kept in good 
<!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
260</span>condition.&nbsp; Houses crept up close to the wall on the city 
side, and began to appear on the opposite side just under the wall.&nbsp; 
Thus a new street was formed, through which ran the old stockade.&nbsp; The
open space along the wall was originally called <i>The Cingel</i>, 
signifying &ldquo;the ramparts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon after the town reached 
the limit of the military reservation, persons residing here were spoken of
as living &ldquo;long de Wal,&rdquo; and from this the street came to be 
called &ldquo;the Wall street,&rdquo; which name it has ever since 
borne.&nbsp; The wall having fallen into decay, was demolished about the 
year 1699, and its stones were used in the construction of the old City 
Hall, which stood at the intersection of Wall and Nassau streets, the site 
now occupied by the Sub-Treasury of the United States.&nbsp; The old 
building was used for the various purposes of the city government until the
close of the Revolution.&nbsp; It contained, besides the council and court 
rooms, a jail for the detention and punishment of criminals, a 
debtors&rsquo; prison, which was located in the attic, a fire-engine-room, 
a cage and a pillory.&nbsp; A pair of stocks was set up on the opposite 
side of the street, wherein criminals were exposed to the indignant gaze of
the virtuous public.</p>
<p>At the close of the Revolution, the City Hall was enlarged and improved 
for the use of the General Government.&nbsp; It thus became the first 
capitol of the new Republic, and was known as Federal Hall.&nbsp; The first
Congress of the United States assembled within its walls in the year 1789, 
and upon its spacious portico, in the presence of an immense multitude, 
George Washington took the oath to support and defend the constitution as 
first President of the United States.</p>
<p>Wall street was originally taken up with private residences, and the old
views represent it as well shaded with trees.&nbsp; Even as late as 1830 it
presented a very rural appearance between Broadway and William 
street.&nbsp; Prior to the Revolution, the lower part of the street had 
been built up with stores as far as Front street, and had become the centre
of mercantile affairs in the city, the row of stores on Wall street being 
the first erected beyond Water street.&nbsp; About the year 1792, the old 
Tontine Coffee House was erected on the northwest corner of Wall and <!-- 
page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>Water 
streets, and this became the favorite rendezvous for the city merchants, by
whom, indeed, it was erected and controlled.&nbsp; In 1791 the Bank of New 
York was located at the corner of William street, and marked the first 
encroachment upon the strictly private portion of the street.&nbsp; It was 
also the first effort to make this locality the centre of the financial 
operations of the city.&nbsp; Other institutions and private bankers soon 
followed, and the character and architecture of the street began to undergo
a change.&nbsp; The work of improvement went on steadily, and the Wall 
street of to-day is the result.&nbsp; Famous lawyers have also had their 
offices in this street.&nbsp; Alexander Hamilton&rsquo;s sign <!-- page 
262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>might once 
have been seen here, not far from where his humble monument now stands in 
Trinity Churchyard, and the name of Caleb Cushing is still to be found near
a doorway just below Broadway.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p261.jpg">
<img alt="UNITED STATES SUB-TREASURY." src="images/p261.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1700 a house and lot on the southeast corner of Wall and Broad
streets, 16 x 30, sold for &pound;163.&nbsp; In 1706 a house and lot on the
north of Wall street, 25 x 116, sold for &pound;116.&nbsp; In 1737 a house 
and lot on the north of Wall street, 62 x 102, sold for &pound;110.&nbsp; 
In 1793, the dwelling and lot of General Alexander Hamilton, on the south 
of Wall street, 42 x 108, sold for &pound;2400.&nbsp; In 1794 a house and 
lot, 44 x 51, sold for &pound;2510.&rdquo;&nbsp; At present the ground 
included in these sites is held at hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The street fairly began its present career in the days of Jacob Little, 
&ldquo;the great bear of Wall street.&rdquo;&nbsp; He opened an office here
in 1822, and by dint of such labor as few men are capable of performing, 
placed himself at the head of American operators.&nbsp; His credit was good
for any amount, and his integrity was unimpeachable.&nbsp; He could sway 
the market as he pleased, and his contracts were met with a punctuality and
fidelity which made &ldquo;his word as good as his bond.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Efforts were made to ruin him, but his genius and far-sightedness enabled 
him to defeat all his enemies with their own weapons.&nbsp; His gains were 
enormous, and so were his losses.&nbsp; The civil war brought upon him 
disasters which he could not surmount, and he died poor in the early part 
of 1861, leaving behind him one of the names of which New York is 
proud.</p>
<p>At the corner of Nassau street, and looking down into Broad street, is 
the Sub-Treasury of the United States, a handsome white marble 
edifice.&nbsp; It is built in the Doric style of architecture, and its 
massive flight of steps and imposing portico give to it a striking 
appearance.&nbsp; It is constructed in the most substantial manner, and has
a rear entrance on Pine street.&nbsp; The interior is handsomely arranged, 
and tasteful but secure iron gratings protect the employees from surprise 
and robbery.&nbsp; The vaults are burglar proof.&nbsp; This is the 
principal depository of the Federal Government, and millions of dollars are
always in <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
263</span>its vaults.&nbsp; The building was erected for, and was used for 
some years as, a Custom House.</p>
<p>From the steps of the Treasury one may enjoy a fine view of the entire 
street, and of Broad street also.&nbsp; About the hour of noon the scene is
busy and exciting.&nbsp; The roadway in Wall street is full of struggling 
vehicles, and long rows of cabs stand in waiting in Broad street for the 
busy operators within the Exchanges.&nbsp; The side walks are crowded with 
an eager, hurrying throng.&nbsp; The steps and street around the Stock 
Exchange, in Broad street, are black with men who are shouting, pushing, 
and struggling in the effort to turn the transactions of the day to their 
advantage.&nbsp; Overhead is an intricate maze of telegraph wires, along 
which flow the quick and feverish pulsations of the great financial heart 
of the country.&nbsp; The sunlight falls brightly and cheerily over it all,
and at intervals the clear, sweet chimes of old Trinity come floating down 
the street high above the noise and strife below them.</p>
<p>Diagonally opposite the Treasury, and at the corner of William street, 
is the Custom House, which occupies the irregular square bounded by Wall 
street, Exchange Place, William street, and Hanover street.&nbsp; It is one
of the finest and best arranged edifices in the city.</p>
<p>Just below the Custom House is the handsome marble building of Brown 
Brothers, one of the model houses of New York, as regards both the firm and
the edifice.&nbsp; The Messrs. Brown are regarded as the most reliable and 
accomplished operators in the street.&nbsp; Across the way, in a dingy 
granite building, is the office of August Belmont &amp; Co., the American 
agents of the Rothschilds, and bankers on their own account.&nbsp; Jay 
Cooke &amp; Co. occupy the fine marble building at the corner of Wall and 
Nassau streets, opposite the Treasury, and there conduct the New York 
branch of their enormous business.&nbsp; Fisk &amp; Hatch, the financial 
agents of the great Pacific Railway, are a few steps higher up Nassau 
street.&nbsp; Henry Clews &amp; Co. are in the building occupied by the 
United States Assay Office.&nbsp; Other firms, of more or less eminence, 
fill the street.&nbsp; Some have fine, showy offices, others operate in 
dark, dingy holes.</p>
<h3><!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
264</span>II.&nbsp; THE STOCK EXCHANGE.</h3>
<p>The Stock Exchange is located on the west side of Broad street, just out
of Wall street.&nbsp; It is a fine white marble edifice, with a portico of 
iron, painted flashily in black and gold.&nbsp; It extends back to New 
street, with an entrance on that street.&nbsp; There is also an entrance on
Wall street.&nbsp; It contains the &ldquo;New York Stock Exchange,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;The Mining Board,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Government Board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the spring and summer of 1871 the internal arrangements of the 
building were very much improved.&nbsp; The refitting cost the brokers 
$60,000, but they now have the handsomest establishment of its kind in the 
world.</p>
<p>The main entrance is on Broad street, and from this the visitor passes 
into a room, the larger portion of which is separated from the Broad street
end by an iron railing.&nbsp; This is &ldquo;The Long Room,&rdquo; and 
during the day it is almost always filled with a noisy and not over-nice 
crowd.&nbsp; It is the scene of the irregular sales of stocks.&nbsp; Any 
one who can raise $50 can purchase a season ticket to this hall, and once 
admitted can sell and purchase stocks without being a member of the Regular
Board.&nbsp; This arrangement has nearly put an end to the sales of stocks 
on the side walks, and has given a tinge of respectability to the class 
known as &ldquo;Curb-stone Brokers.&rdquo;&nbsp; A dozen or more different 
stocks may be sold here at once, and the sale may be continued as long as 
the seller sees fit.&nbsp; There is no regular organization of the brokers 
operating here, though these men control the bulk of the sales made in the 
street.&nbsp; They are noisy and seem half demented in their frantic 
efforts to make sales.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Stock Exchange&rdquo; occupies the main hall, which is on the
floor above the Long Room.&nbsp; This hall is one of the most beautiful 
apartments in the city.&nbsp; It is seventy-four feet long, fifty-four feet
wide, and fifty-two feet four inches high.&nbsp; Its lofty ceiling is 
arched and decorated with bright red and buff <!-- page 265--><a 
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>penciling upon a sky 
blue ground, while the walls are relieved by broad square pilasters, 
painted in brilliant bronze, with tall windows and arched tops rising 
between, and other spaces between the columns covered with drapery in more 
subdued colors.&nbsp; Up to a few feet from the floor the painting is in a 
dark-hued bronze.&nbsp; The coloring is in the Moorish style throughout, 
and the effect of the whole is very fine.&nbsp; At the north end is the 
platform for the desks of the Vice-President and Secretary, and on each 
side of this is a black board for recording the quotations of the 
session.&nbsp; On the same platform is the desk and instrument of the stock
telegraph operator.&nbsp; At the south end of the hall is a light gallery 
capable of holding 200 persons, for the use of visitors.&nbsp; In 
connection with the hall are several committee, cloak and ante-rooms.&nbsp;
In the centre of the ceiling is a huge ventilator, beneath which is 
suspended the lighting apparatus, containing 100 burners.&nbsp; A chamber 
five feet in depth underlies the hall and the adjoining lobby, and in it 
are laid pipes for conducting warm air.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p265.jpg">
<img alt="THE STOCK EXCHANGE." src="images/p265.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At the base of the walls is an open iron grating covering the <!-- page 
266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>apertures of
a shaft leading from the engine-room.&nbsp; Through this shaft warm air is 
forced into the hall in winter, and cool air in summer, thus securing 
perfect ventilation.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange Board is an incorporated company, and is the only 
lawful association in the city for the transaction of business connected 
with stocks.&nbsp; It consists of 1050 members, but the control of its 
affairs is vested in a council of forty members, together with the 
President, Secretary and Treasurer in their unofficial capacity.&nbsp; The 
admission fee is $5000, and a seat in the Board becomes the absolute 
personal property of the broker, who can sell or otherwise dispose of it as
he would of his watch or his coat.&nbsp; Candidates are admitted by ballot 
and with great care, the object being to secure the exclusion of all but 
men of known integrity, for the Board requires the most scrupulous good 
faith in the transactions of all its members.&nbsp; Four black balls will 
prevent the admission of a candidate whether he wishes to enter by purchase
or otherwise.&nbsp; Candidates must submit to a close scrutiny of their 
previous lives, and must show a clear record.</p>
<p>There are two daily sessions of the Board, one in the morning and the 
other in the afternoon.&nbsp; The securities offered at these meetings are 
divided into two classes, the Regular and the Free List.&nbsp; No stock or 
bond can be dealt in until it has been rigidly examined by a committee, and
found to be a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> security.</p>
<p>At half-past ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the Morning Board is 
called to order by the First Vice-President.&nbsp; The Regular List, which 
is made up in advance of the meeting, must always be called, and called 
first.&nbsp; The Free List may be called or not at the option of the 
Board.&nbsp; The Regular List consists of 1st.&nbsp; Miscellaneous 
Stocks.&nbsp; 2d.&nbsp; Railroad Stocks.&nbsp; 3d.&nbsp; State Bonds.&nbsp;
4th.&nbsp; City Stocks.&nbsp; 5th.&nbsp; Railroad Bonds.</p>
<p>The session opens with the reading of the minutes of the previous 
day.&nbsp; Then comes the call of the Regular List.&nbsp; The call of 
Miscellaneous Stocks awakens but little excitement.&nbsp; Bids follow 
quickly upon the announcement of the stocks, and the transactions, as they 
are announced by the <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>cries of the brokers are repeated by the 
Vice-President to the Assistant Secretary, who records them in the journal,
and they are also recorded by a clerk on a black board in full view of the 
members.&nbsp; Where there is a doubt respecting a sale or purchase the 
Vice-President decides, and his decision is final, unless reversed by the 
votes of a majority of the members present.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p267.jpg">
<img alt="THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE BOARD IN SESSION." 
src="images/p267.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The call of railroad securities brings the brokers to their feet, and 
the real business of the day begins.&nbsp; Offers and bids, shouted in deep
bass, high treble, or shrill falsetto, resound through the hall, and in a 
few minutes the jovial-looking brokers seem to be on the verge of 
madness.&nbsp; How they yell and shout, and stamp, and gesticulate.&nbsp; 
The roar and confusion are bewildering to a stranger, but the keen, 
practised ears of the Vice-President at once recognize the various 
transactions, and down they go in the Secretary&rsquo;s book, and on the 
black board, while the solemn-vizaged telegraph operator sends them 
clicking into every broker&rsquo;s office in the city.&nbsp; High over all 
rings the voice of Peter, the keeper of the gate, calling out members for 
whom telegrams or visitors have arrived.</p>
<p>The other stocks awaken more or less excitement, and when the Regular 
List is completed, the Free List is in order, and the Vice-President calls 
such stocks as the members express a desire to deal in.&nbsp; Then, unless 
there is a wish to call up some stock hastily passed over on the call of 
the Regular List, the session closes.</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock, the afternoon session is held, and the routine of 
the morning is gone over again.&nbsp; The transactions of both sessions are
carefully recorded in the Secretary&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>The Vice-President receives a salary of $7000 per annum for his 
services, which are not light.&nbsp; The Secretary and Assistant Secretary,
and Roll-keeper do the rest of the work of the Board.&nbsp; The last named 
keeps a record of the fines, which yield an exceedingly large revenue to 
the Board.&nbsp; The brokers are not the most dignified of mortals in their
meetings, but are very much given to disorderly conduct and practical 
jokes.&nbsp; The annual dues of the Exchange are but fifty dollars, but the
<!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
269</span>average broker pays at least ten times as much in fines.&nbsp; To
interrupt the presiding officer during a call of the stocks subjects the 
offender to a fine of not less than twenty-five cents for each offence; to 
smoke a cigar within the Exchange costs five dollars; to be absent from 
special meetings is to incur a fine of not more than five dollars; to stand
on a table or chair is punishable with a fine of one dollar; to throw a 
paper dart or ball at a member during the session of the Board costs ten 
dollars; and other offences may be punished with fines assessed by the 
Vice-President at any sum between twenty-five cents and five dollars.</p>
<p>Each day a list of stocks to be put in the market is made out, and no 
others can be sold during the sessions.&nbsp; The Board can refuse to offer
any particular stock for sale, and a guarantee is required of the party 
making the sale.&nbsp; The members of the Board are men of character, and 
their transactions are fair and open.&nbsp; They are required to fulfil all
contracts in good faith, however great the loss to themselves, on pain of 
expulsion from the Board, and it is very rare that an expelled member can 
be reinstated.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; THE GOVERNMENT BOARD.</h3>
<p>The room used by the Government Board, in which all transactions in the 
bonds and securities of the United States take place, is located on the 
second floor of the Exchange building.&nbsp; It is handsomely frescoed and 
furnished in green rep.&nbsp; The basement beneath this room is an immense 
vault, containing 618 safes, arranged in three tiers, and guarded by four 
policemen detailed for that purpose.&nbsp; These safes are a foot and a 
half square, and are rented by the brokers who deposit in them overnight 
small tin boxes containing their bonds and other securities.&nbsp; It is 
estimated that the value of the securities nightly deposited here is over 
two hundred millions of dollars.</p>
<p><!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
270</span>The seats of the brokers in the Government Room are arranged in 
tiers, rising one above the other, from the floor to the wall.&nbsp; The 
officers occupy a platform at the head of the chamber.&nbsp; The order of 
business is very much like that of the Stock Board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vice-President begins:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;6s &rsquo;81 registered&mdash;&rsquo;81 coupon.&nbsp; 
5.20s &rsquo;62 registered&mdash;coupon.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s bid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here and there from flanking chairs come sputtering bids or 
offers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ten thousand at 3/8, buyer 3.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give an 1/8, seller 3, for the lot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&frac14;, buyer 30, for fifty thousand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&frac14;, regular, for any part of five 
thousand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>First Voice</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sold,&mdash;five 
hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The presiding officer repeats the sale and terms, the secretary 
makes his registry, and a new bond is started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes when 5.20s are called, there is at first only one voice
which rings the changes on &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give 115.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll 
give &rsquo;15 for a thousand,&mdash;&rsquo;15 for a thousand.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Presently, however, before any response follows the offer, a member in a 
distant corner, either carelessly or maliciously, shouts out, 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;14 for a thousand,&mdash;&rsquo;14 for a 
thousand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vice-President plies his hammer: &lsquo;Fine 
Irving&mdash;fine Irving fifty cents.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Roll keeper proceeds
to make his little note of it, and Irving, who has violated the rule, 
founded on common sense, which forbids a member from making a bid below or 
an offer above the one which has the floor immediately subsides amid the 
laughter of his neighbors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Occasionally an interruption of a grosser character occurs, a 
member leaping from his seat on some slight provocation, and striking off 
the hat of the man who has offended.&nbsp; Fine Harrison, fine Harrison 
again, <i>fine</i>, <span class="smcap">fine</span> him again,&mdash;<span 
class="smcap">fine</span> Harrison,&rsquo; cries the Vice-President, 
repeating the word without cessation until the broker&rsquo;s wrath has 
been appeased, and he returns to his chair with the disagreeable reflection
that a heavy score is against him for the semi-annual settlement-day.&nbsp;
Every <!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
271</span>repetition of that fatal monosyllable was a fresh mark of fifty 
cents or a dollar against his name.&nbsp; Generally, however, the 
Government brokers are more orderly than their neighbors in the Regular 
Board.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole proceedings are more decorous and 
respectful, the bidding, half the time, being carried on in a low 
conversational tone.&nbsp; At second call there is a brief excitement, but 
when &lsquo;things are dull&rsquo; throughout the street, this room 
peculiarly reflects the external influences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very different it is, however, on days when some special cause 
provokes great fluctuations.&nbsp; Then the members spring from their 
seats, arms, hands, excitable faces, rapid vociferations, all come in play,
and the element of pantomime performs its part in assisting the human voice
as naturally as among the Italians of Syracuse.&nbsp; To the uninitiated 
the biddings here are as unintelligible as elsewhere, sounding to ordinary 
ears like the gibberish of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s Compachinos.&nbsp; But the 
comparative quietude of this Board renders it easier to follow the course 
of the market, to detect the shades of difference in the running offers, 
and generally to get a clearer conception of this part of the machinery of 
stock brokerage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In former times brokers were subjected to great expense in keeping a 
host of runners and messengers to bring them news of the transactions at 
the Exchanges.&nbsp; The introduction of the Stock Telegraph has made a 
great and beneficial change in this respect.&nbsp; In every broker&rsquo;s 
office, and in the principal hotels and restaurants of the city, there is 
an automatic recording instrument connected by telegraphic wires with an 
instrument in the Stock and Gold Exchanges.&nbsp; The operator in these 
exchanges indicates the quotations of stocks and gold on his own 
instrument, and these quotations are repeated by the instruments in the 
offices throughout the city.&nbsp; These office instruments print the 
quotations in plain Roman letters and figures on a ribbon of paper, so that
any one can read and understand them.&nbsp; Thus one man does the work 
formerly required of several hundred, and no time is lost in conveying the 
information.&nbsp; The broker in his office is informed of the transactions
at the Exchange at the very instant they are made.</p>
<h3><!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
272</span>IV.&nbsp; THE GOLD EXCHANGE.</h3>
<p>You pass from Broad street into the basement of a brown stone building 
just below the Stock Exchange, and find yourself in a long, dimly-lighted 
passage way, which leads into a small courtyard.&nbsp; Before you is a 
steep stairway leading to a narrow and dirty entry.&nbsp; At the end of 
this entry is a gloomy looking door.&nbsp; Pass through it, and you are in 
the famous Gold Exchange.</p>
<p>This is a showy apartment in the style of an amphitheatre, with an ugly 
fountain in the centre of the floor.&nbsp; An iron railing encloses the 
fountain.&nbsp; Against the New street end is the platform occupied by the 
President and Secretary, and on the right of this is the telegraph 
office.&nbsp; There are two galleries connected with the room, one for the 
use of visitors provided with tickets, and the other free to all 
comers.&nbsp; There is an indicator on the outer wall of the building on 
New street, from which the price of gold is announced to the crowd 
without.&nbsp; It is a common habit with sporting men of the lower class to
frequent New street and bet on the indicator.</p>
<p>There are but few benches in the Gold Room.&nbsp; The members of the 
Board are too nervous and excitable to sit still, and seats would soon be 
broken to pieces in their wild rushing up and down the floor.</p>
<p>The business of the day begins about ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The rap of
the President&rsquo;s gavel opens the session, and as there is but one 
thing dealt in&mdash;gold&mdash;the bids follow the sound of the 
mallet.&nbsp; The noise and confusion are greater here than in the Stock 
Board or the Long Room, and it seems impossible to a stranger that the 
President should be able to follow the various transactions.&nbsp; When the
excitement is at its height, the scene resembles &ldquo;pandemonium broken 
loose.&rdquo;&nbsp; The members rush wildly about, without any apparent 
aim.&nbsp; They stamp, yell, shake their arms, heads, and bodies violently,
and almost trample each other to death in their frenzied struggles.&nbsp; 
Men <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
273</span>who in private life excite the admiration of their friends by the
repose and dignity of their manner, here join in the furious whirl, and 
seem more like maniacs than sensible human beings.&nbsp; And yet every 
yell, every gesture, is fraught with the most momentous consequences.&nbsp;
These seeming maniacs have a method in their madness, and are changing at 
every breath the value of the currency upon which the whole business of the
country rests.&nbsp; When the fluctuations are very great, fortunes are 
made and lost here every hour.</p>
<p>Connected with the business of the Gold Room are the Gold Exchange Bank 
and the Clearing House.&nbsp; The method of settlement with these 
institutions, which are indispensable where gold passes so rapidly from 
hand to hand in the Exchange, is as follows: &ldquo;On or before half past 
twelve o&rsquo;clock, a statement of all the purchases or sales made by 
each broker on the preceding day must be rendered to the bank.&nbsp; If the
gold bought be in excess of that sold, a check for the difference must 
accompany the statement.&nbsp; If deposits in gold or currency are not kept
in the bank, the coin must be delivered at every deficiency.&nbsp; The 
Board adjourns at twelve, in order to enable tardy dealers to complete 
their accounts.&nbsp; Provided all contracts are honored, the bank must 
settle by two P.M.&nbsp; In case of default, the amount in abeyance is 
debited or credited to the broker who suffers by the failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Clearing House Association was created in 1853, and represents the 
sum of the financial business of the city.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Association is 
located in the third story of the building of the Bank of New York.&nbsp; 
The centre of the room is occupied by a bank counter, extending on four 
sides, with a passage inside and out.&nbsp; Fifty-nine desks are placed on 
the counter for the use of the fifty-nine banks represented in the 
Association.&nbsp; Each desk bears the name of the bank to which it 
belongs.&nbsp; Fitted up in each desk are fifty-nine pigeon holes for the 
checks of the various banks.&nbsp; Two clerks represent each bank.&nbsp; 
One remains at the desk and receives all the checks on his bank.&nbsp; He 
signs the name of the bank to the sheet which each outside clerk holds in 
his hand.&nbsp; These outside clerks go from desk to desk and <!-- page 
274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>leave the 
checks received the day before, with the banks on which they are 
drawn.&nbsp; Banks do not begin public business till ten; but clerks have 
to be on hand at eight, when all checks are assorted and arranged for 
delivery at the Clearing House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ten minutes before ten the bank messengers begin to assemble 
and take their places.&nbsp; As they enter they leave with the messenger a 
slip containing an exact account of the bank they represent.&nbsp; These 
statements are put on a sheet prepared for that purpose, and must conform 
precisely to the checks received inside, before the Clearing House closes 
its duties.&nbsp; If there is any error or discrepancy, the bank is 
immediately notified by telegraph, and the clerks kept until the matter is 
satisfactorily adjusted.&nbsp; At ten, promptly, business begins.&nbsp; 
Clerks come rushing in with small trunks, tin boxes, or with bundles in 
their arms, and take their seats at the desks.&nbsp; On the side of the 
room entered only from the manager&rsquo;s office is a desk, not unlike a 
pulpit.&nbsp; Precisely at ten the bell rings, the manager steps into his 
box, brings down his gavel, and the work of the day begins.&nbsp; Quiet 
prevails.&nbsp; No loud talking is allowed, and no confusion.&nbsp; A bank 
late is fined two dollars; a party violating the rules, or guilty of 
insubordination, is fined two dollars and reported to the hank.&nbsp; On 
repetition, he is expelled the Clearing House.&nbsp; The daily transactions
of the Clearing House varies from ninety-eight to one hundred 
millions.&nbsp; The system is so nicely balanced that three millions daily 
settle the difference.&nbsp; Each bank indebted to the Clearing House must 
send in its check before half after one.&nbsp; Creditors get the Clearing 
House check at the same hour.&nbsp; Daily business is squared and all 
accounts closed at half after three.&nbsp; Every bank in the city is 
connected with the Clearing House by telegraph.&nbsp; The morning work of 
clearing one hundred millions, occupies ten minutes.&nbsp; Long before the 
clerks can reach the bank, its officers are acquainted with the exact state
of their account, and know what loans to grant or refuse.&nbsp; Through the
Clearing House each bank is connected with every other in the city.&nbsp; 
If a doubtful check is presented, if paper to be negotiated is not exactly 
clear, while the party offering the paper or check is entertained by <!-- 
page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>some 
member of the bank, the telegraph is making minute inquiries about his 
financial standing.&nbsp; Before the conference closes, the bank knows the 
exact facts of the case.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>V.&nbsp; CURB-STONE BROKERS.</h3>
<p>The members of the Stock and Gold Exchange, as has been stated, are men 
of character.&nbsp; Their transactions are governed by certain fixed rules,
and they are required, on pain of expulsion from the Exchange, to observe 
the strictest good faith in their dealings with each other and with their 
customers.&nbsp; If the operations of the street were entirely confined to 
them, business in Wall street might be regarded as in safe hands.&nbsp; But
there is another class, even more numerous and quite as well skilled in the
ways of the street, who transact a vast part of its business.&nbsp; They 
are not members of the Exchange, and in former times used to assemble 
around its doors in Broad and New streets, and carry on their operations on
the sidewalk.&nbsp; Hence their designation, &ldquo;Curb-stone 
brokers.&rdquo;&nbsp; They no longer assemble on the pavement, for the 
Exchange has thrown open to them its Long Room.&nbsp; Any one who can pay 
$50 a year for a ticket of admission, and who has brains and nerve enough 
to enter upon the struggle, can sell or buy in the Long Room.&nbsp; This is
better than standing in the street, exposed to the weather, and moreover 
gives a certain respectability to the &ldquo;operator,&rdquo; although he 
may carry his sole capital in his head, and his office in his 
breeches-pocket.</p>
<p>No rules or regulations apply to the Long Room.&nbsp; The honest man and
the rogue mingle together here, and the broker must be sure of his 
man.&nbsp; Many of the members of the Exchange buy and sell here, either in
person or through their representatives, and many good men who are unable 
to enter the Exchange conduct their business here.&nbsp; Others again 
prefer the freedom and the wider field of the Long Room.&nbsp; Still, there
are many sharpers here, who would fleece a victim out of his last cent.</p>
<p><!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
276</span>The daily transactions of the Long Room are said to average about
$70,000,000, or ten times the business done in the Regular Board.&nbsp; 
Fortune is much more uncertain here than in the room up stairs.&nbsp; Men 
buy and sell here with the recklessness of gamblers.&nbsp; The noise and 
excitement are almost as great as in the Gold Room.&nbsp; The absence of 
the fixed laws of the Regular Boards puts every one on his own resources, 
and men are compelled to use all their ingenuity, all their determination 
to guard against a surprise or unfair dealing.&nbsp; It is every one for 
himself here.&nbsp; A dozen or more small or new operators are ruined and 
swept away daily, and in times of great financial excitement the Long Room 
shakes the foundations of even some of the strongest houses in the 
street.</p>
<h3>VI.&nbsp; THE BUSINESS OF THE STREET.</h3>
<p>It is a common habit to speak of Wall street as the financial centre of 
the Republic; but only those who are acquainted with its transactions can 
know how true this is.&nbsp; Regarding Wall street and New York as 
synonymous terms, we find that the street is not only a great power in this
country, but that it is one of the great controlling powers of the 
financial world.&nbsp; Indeed, if the prosperity of the country is as 
marked in the future as it has been in the past, there is good reason to 
believe that Wall street will control the whole world of finance.&nbsp; Its
geographical location is in its favor.&nbsp; By noon the New York broker 
has full information of the same day&rsquo;s transactions in London, 
Frankfort, and Paris, and can shape his course in accordance with this 
knowledge, while the European broker cannot profit by his knowledge of 
matters in New York until the next day.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange of New York numbers over 1000 members, and its 
aggregate wealth is greater than that of any similar association in the 
world.&nbsp; The par value of the annual sales made at the regular Boards 
and &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; is <!-- page 277--><a 
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>estimated at over 
$22,000,000,000 annually.&nbsp; The par value of the authorized stocks, 
bonds, and Governments dealt in by the regular Boards is more than 
$3,000,000,000, and this vast sum is turned over and over many times during
the year.&nbsp; The aggregate of the brokers&rsquo; commissions on the 
sales and purchases made by them is estimated by competent authority at 
$43,750,000 annually.&nbsp; The bulk of this enormous business is in the 
hands of about 400 houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of all the incorporated banks in the United States, there are
thirty situated in Wall street and its neighborhood, whose office is not 
unlike that of the heart in the economy of animal life.&nbsp; Although less
than half the full number of banks in the metropolis, these thirty have 
two-thirds of the capital, and quite two-thirds of the circulation.&nbsp; 
By a provision of statutory law, all outside National banks, numbering some
1600, are allowed to keep one-half, and many three-fifths, of their reserve
balances in New York.&nbsp; In this way our great financial centre is 
rapidly acquiring the function of a National clearing-house.&nbsp; These 
temporary deposits bear a small interest, and are subject to be called for 
at a day&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; They can only be used, therefore, by the 
employing banks on the same conditions.&nbsp; The stock market supplies 
these conditions.&nbsp; Bonds and shares bought to-day and sold to-morrow, 
endowed with all the properties of swift conversion, and held by men whose 
training has been one of incessant grappling with the new and unexpected, 
are the only class of property upon which money can safely be borrowed 
without a protection against sudden demands.&nbsp; On these securities, 
therefore, the down-town banks make call loans.&nbsp; The name implies the 
nature.&nbsp; The money which the thirty receive from without, together 
with their own reserves, is lent freely to stock-brokers, with the simple 
provision that it must be returned immediately upon notice, if financial 
exigencies require it.&nbsp; This vast volume of what may well be styled 
fluid wealth is difficult of estimate in figures.&nbsp; The published 
statements of loans made by city banks make no distinction between 
discounts of commercial paper and what is advanced on securities.&nbsp; In 
sum total, the thirty banks lend <!-- page 278--><a 
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>weekly about 
$165,000,000.&nbsp; Indeed, including all New York banks, the average is 
nearly $255,000,000.&nbsp; During the week ending September 18, 1868, these
banks lent $266,496,024.&nbsp; The real meaning of these last figures will 
be better understood when it is known that they exceed the entire average 
loans and discounts of all the national banks of New England and New York 
State, with the exception, of course, of the city itself.&nbsp; <!-- page 
279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>Or, to take 
a more sweeping view, they surpass the total weekly loans of national banks
in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, 
Georgia, Alabama, Texas, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Nebraska, 
Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, 
Delaware, and New Jersey.&nbsp; Nigh $180,000,000 of the amount cited above
were advanced by the down-town banks.&nbsp; What proportion of this was 
lent on stocks?&nbsp; Probably much over one-third.&nbsp; As many of the 
other banks also make call loans, we may, perhaps, estimate that from 
$70,000,000 to $100,000,000 are furnished daily to the brokers and 
operators of New York.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p278.jpg">
<img alt="THE PARK BANK, BROADWAY." src="images/p278.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;This, however, is but one element in the lending force of the 
city.&nbsp; There are five Trust Companies, with capitals amounting in the 
aggregate to $5,500,000, which lend, at times, $60,000,000 a week.&nbsp; 
There are also a large number of private banking houses, of which Jay Cooke
&amp; Co. may be selected as representatives, that daily loan vast sums of 
money on security.&nbsp; The foreign houses alone, which, like Belmont 
&amp; Co., Brown Brothers, Drexel, Winthrop &amp; Co., operate in Wall 
street, employ not much less than $200,000,000 of capital.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>VII.&nbsp; STOCK GAMBLING.</h3>
<p>In the good old days gone by Wall street did business on principles very
different from those which prevail there now.&nbsp; Then there was a holy 
horror in all hearts of speculation.&nbsp; Irresponsible men might indulge 
in it, and so incur the censure of the more respectable, but established 
houses confined themselves to a legitimate and regular business.&nbsp; They
bought and sold on commission, and were satisfied with their 
earnings.&nbsp; Even now, indeed, the best houses profess to do simply a 
commission business, leaving the risk to the customer, but those who know 
the hidden ways of the street hint that there is not a house in it but has 
its secrets of large or small operations undertaken on account of the 
firm.&nbsp; The practice of buying <!-- page 280--><a 
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>and selling on 
commission is unquestionably the safest, but the mania for wealth leads 
many clear, cool-headed men into the feverish whirl of speculation, and 
keeps them there until they have realized their wildest hopes, or are 
ruined.</p>
<p>It has been remarked that the men who do business in Wall street have a 
prematurely old look, and that they die at a comparatively early age.&nbsp;
This is not strange.&nbsp; They live too fast.&nbsp; Their bodies and 
brains are taxed too severely to last long.&nbsp; They pass their days in a
state of great excitement.&nbsp; Every little fluctuation of the market 
elates or depresses them to an extent greater than they think.&nbsp; At 
night they are either planning the next day&rsquo;s campaign, or are hard 
at work at the hotels.&nbsp; On Sundays their minds are still on their 
business, and some are laboring in their offices, screened from public 
observation.&nbsp; Body and mind are worked too hard, and are given no 
rest.</p>
<p>The chief cause of this intense strain is the uncertainty attending the 
operations of Wall street.&nbsp; The chances there are not dependent upon 
the skill or the exertions of the operator.&nbsp; Some powerful clique may 
almost destroy the securities upon which he relies for success, or may make
him wealthy by suddenly running up their value; so that no man who does not
confine himself to a strictly legitimate or commission business&mdash;and 
but few do so&mdash;can say one week whether he will be a millionaire or a 
beggar the next.&nbsp; The chances are in favor of the latter result.&nbsp;
Nine out of ten who speculate in gold or stocks, lose, especially persons 
unaccustomed to such operations.&nbsp; Like all gamblers, they are 
undismayed by their losses, and venture a second time, and a third, and so 
on.&nbsp; The fascination of stock gambling is equal to that of card 
gambling, and holds its victims with an iron hand.&nbsp; The only safe rule
for those who wish to grow rich is to keep out of Wall street.&nbsp; While 
one man makes a fortune by a sudden rise in stocks or gold, hundreds lose 
by an equally sudden fall in the same commodities.&nbsp; Even old and 
established firms sometimes give way with a crash under these sudden 
changes.</p>
<p>The legitimate operations of the street and the speculative ventures are
becoming more and more concentrated every year in <!-- page 281--><a 
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>the hands of a few 
operators and capitalists.&nbsp; These move the market as they please, and 
fill their coffers, and sweep away younger or weaker men with a remorseless
hand.&nbsp; It is useless to oppose them.&nbsp; They are masters of the 
field in every respect, and when they combine for a common object, their 
resources are inexhaustible and their power beyond computation.&nbsp; A 
dozen, or even half a dozen of the great capitalists could ruin the whole 
street were they so disposed, and once they came near doing so.&nbsp; This 
is the secret of the cordial hatred that is felt by the majority of Wall 
street men for Vanderbilt, Drew, and other great operators.&nbsp; They know
and dread the power of these men, and would readily combine to destroy them
singly.</p>
<p>The mania for stock gambling which now sways such masses of people, may 
be said to date from the war and the petroleum discoveries.&nbsp; Since 
then it has rolled over the country in a vast flood.&nbsp; The telegraph is
kept busy all day and all night in sending orders for speculations from 
people in other States and cities to New York brokers.&nbsp; Everybody who 
can raise the funds, wishes to try his or her hand at a venture in 
stocks.&nbsp; Merchants, clergymen, women, professional men, clerks, come 
here to tempt fortune.&nbsp; Many win; more lose.</p>
<p>Fortunes are made quicker and lost more easily in New York than in any 
place in the world.&nbsp; A sudden rise in stocks, or a lucky venture of 
some other kind, often places a comparatively poor man in possession of 
great wealth.&nbsp; Watch the carriages as they whirl through Fifth avenue,
going and returning from the park.&nbsp; They are as elegant and sumptuous 
as wealth can make them.&nbsp; The owners, lying back amongst the soft 
cushions, are clad in the height of fashion.&nbsp; By their dresses they 
might be princes and princesses.&nbsp; This much is due to art.&nbsp; Now 
mark the coarse, rough features, the ill-bred stare, the haughty rudeness 
which they endeavor to palm off for dignity.&nbsp; Do you see any 
difference between them and the footman in livery on the 
carriage-box?&nbsp; Both master and man belong to the same class&mdash;only
one is wealthy and the other is not.&nbsp; But that footman may take the 
place of the master in a couple of years, or in less time.&nbsp; Such 
changes may seem remarkable, but they are very common in New York.</p>
<p><!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
282</span>See that gentleman driving that splendid pair of sorrels.&nbsp; 
He is a fine specimen of mere animal beauty.&nbsp; How well he 
drives.&nbsp; The ease and carelessness with which he manages his splendid 
steeds, excites the admiration of every one on the road.&nbsp; He is used 
to it.&nbsp; Five years ago he was the driver of a public hack.&nbsp; He 
amassed a small sum of money, and being naturally a sharp, shrewd man, went
into Wall street, and joined the &ldquo;Curb-stone Brokers.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
His transactions were not always open to a rigid scrutiny, but they were 
profitable to him.&nbsp; He invested in oil stocks, and with his usual good
luck made a fortune.&nbsp; Now he operates through his broker.&nbsp; His 
transactions are heavy, his speculations bold and daring, but he is usually
successful.&nbsp; He lives in great splendor in one of the finest mansions 
in the city, and his carriages and horses are superb.&nbsp; His wife and 
daughters are completely carried away by their good fortune, and look with 
disdain upon all who are not their equals or superiors in wealth.&nbsp; 
They are vulgar and ill-bred, but they are wealthy, and society worships 
them.&nbsp; There will come a change some day.&nbsp; The husband and father
will venture once too often in his speculations, and his magnificent 
fortune will go with a crash, and the family will return to their former 
state, or perhaps sink lower, for there are very few men who have the moral
courage to try to rise again after such a fall, and this man is not one of 
them.</p>
<p>In watching the crowd on Broadway, one will frequently see, in some 
shabbily dressed individual, who, with his hat drawn down close over his 
eyes, is evidently shrinking from the possibility of being recognized, the 
man who but a few weeks ago was one of the wealthiest in the city.&nbsp; 
Then he was surrounded with splendor.&nbsp; Now he hardly knows where to 
get bread for his family.&nbsp; Then he lived in an elegant mansion.&nbsp; 
Now one or two rooms on the upper floor of some tenement house constitute 
his habitation.&nbsp; He shrinks from meeting his old friends, well knowing
that not one of them will recognize him, except to insult him with a 
scornful stare.&nbsp; Families are constantly disappearing from the social 
circles in which they have shone for a greater or less time.&nbsp; They 
vanish almost in an instant, and are never seen again.&nbsp; You may meet 
them at some brilliant ball in the evening.&nbsp; Pass their residence the 
next day, <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
283</span>and you will see a bill announcing the early sale of the mansion 
and furniture.&nbsp; The worldly effects of the family are all in the hands
of the creditors of the &ldquo;head,&rdquo; and the family themselves are 
either in a more modest home in the country, or in a tenement house.&nbsp; 
You can scarcely walk twenty blocks on Fifth avenue, without seeing one of 
these bills, telling its mournful story of fallen greatness.</p>
<p>The best and safest way to be rich in New York, as elsewhere, is for a 
man to confine himself to his legitimate business.&nbsp; Few men acquire 
wealth suddenly.&nbsp; Ninety-nine fail where one succeeds.&nbsp; The bane 
of New York commercial life, however, is that people have not the patience 
to wait for fortune.&nbsp; Every one wants to be rich in a hurry, and as no
regular business will accomplish this, here or elsewhere, speculation is 
resorted to.&nbsp; The sharpers and tricksters who infest Wall street know 
this weakness of New York merchants.&nbsp; They take the pains to inform 
themselves as to the character, means and credulity of merchants, and then 
use every art to draw them into speculations, in which the tempter is 
enriched and the tempted ruined.&nbsp; In nine cases out of ten a merchant 
is utterly ignorant of the nature of the speculation he engages in.&nbsp; 
He is not capable of forming a reasonable opinion as to its propriety or 
chance of success, because the whole transaction is new to him, and is so 
rapid that he has no time to study it.&nbsp; He leaves a business in which 
he has acquired valuable knowledge and experience, and trusts himself to 
the mercy of a man he knows little or nothing of; and undertakes a 
transaction that he does not know how to manage.&nbsp; Dabbling in 
speculations unfits men for their regular pursuits.&nbsp; They come to like
the excitement of such ventures, and rush on in their mad course, hoping to
make up their losses by one lucky speculation, and at length utter ruin 
rouses them from their dreams.</p>
<p>Not only do men squander their own money in this way, but they risk and 
often lose the funds of others committed to their charge.&nbsp; Bank 
officers, having the use of the deposits in their institutions, take them 
for speculation, intending of course to return them.&nbsp; Sometimes they 
are successful, and are able to <!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>replace the money in the bank, so that no one 
hears of their dishonesty.&nbsp; Again, and most commonly, they fail, and 
they are ruined.&nbsp; Guardians thus misappropriate the funds of their 
wards.&nbsp; Even the funds of churches are thus used by their 
trustees.&nbsp; The amount of speculation engaged in by clergymen with 
their own money would astonish a novice.&nbsp; Some prominent divines in 
the city are well known in Wall street.&nbsp; Their brokers keep their 
secrets, but the habitu&eacute;s of the street are adepts at putting this 
and that together, and these reverend gentlemen, some of whom preach 
eloquently against the sins of speculation and gambling, become known as 
regular customers.&nbsp; The street is full of gossip concerning them, and 
if the stories told of them be true, some of them have made large fortunes 
in this way, while others have literally &ldquo;gone to the bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not necessary that a person speculating in stocks should be master
of the entire value of the stocks.&nbsp; If he be known to the broker 
operating for him as a responsible person, he may employ only ten per 
cent., or some other proportion, of the stock to be dealt in.&nbsp; By 
depositing $1000 with his broker, he can speculate to the extent of 
$10,000.&nbsp; This per centage is called a <i>margin</i>, and the deposit 
is designed to protect the broker from loss in case the stock should fall 
in value.&nbsp; As the stock depreciates, the customer must either sell out
and bear the loss which is inevitable, or he must increase his margin to an
extent sufficient to protect his broker.&nbsp; If he fails to increase his 
margin, the broker sells the stock and uses the money to save himself.</p>
<h3>VIII.&nbsp; THE WAYS OF THE STREET.</h3>
<p>Like Brette Harte&rsquo;s Heathen Chinee,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For ways that are dark<br />
And tricks that are vain,<br />
Wall Street is peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It takes a clear, cool head, a large amount of brains, and unaltering 
nerve, to thread one&rsquo;s way through the intricacies of <!-- page 
285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>the business
of finance as carried on there.&nbsp; It would be interesting to know how 
many come out of the ordeal untouched by the taint of corruption.&nbsp; 
Members of the Exchanges are held by a rigid code of laws, but in questions
of morality Wall street has a code of its own.&nbsp; Expediency is a 
prominent consideration in the dealings of the street, and men have come to
regard as honest and correct almost anything short of a regular breach of 
contract.&nbsp; They do not spare their own flesh and blood.&nbsp; 
Friendships are sacrificed, the ties of kinship are disregarded, if they 
stand in the way of some bold operation.&nbsp; Every thing must give way to
the desire for gain.&nbsp; The great operators plunder and destroy their 
lesser rivals without a feeling of remorse, and by combinations which they 
know cannot be resisted blast the prospects and ruin the lives of scores 
whose greatest fault is an inability to oppose them successfully.&nbsp; 
Tricks so mean and contemptible that their perpetrator would not be 
tolerated in social life, are resorted to, and if successful are applauded 
as evidences of smartness.&nbsp; Every man&rsquo;s hand is against his 
neighbor.&nbsp; Clerks are bribed to betray the secrets of their 
employers.&nbsp; The baser their treachery, the larger their reward.&nbsp; 
We do not propose, however, to discuss the morality of Wall street 
transactions, and so we drop the subject.</p>
<p>It is said by the gossips of the street that the great Railroad King, 
Commodore Vanderbilt, is not above using any means at hand to secure the 
success of his schemes.&nbsp; It is said that he once tried to use his son 
William in this way.&nbsp; He came to him one day, and advised him that he 
had better sell his Hudson River stock, as 110 was too high for it.&nbsp; 
William thanked him, and made inquiries in the market, and found that his 
father was buying quietly all he could lay his hands upon.</p>
<p>William determined to follow suit.&nbsp; Up jumped the stock to 
137.&nbsp; It was a clear twenty-six per cent. in pocket.</p>
<p>When the operation was concluded, the Commodore rode round to the 
son&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, William, how much did you lose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went in at 110 on 10,000 shares.&nbsp; That ought to make me 
two hundred and sixty thousand dollars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
286</span>&ldquo;Very bad luck, William,&rdquo; quoth the father, trying to
look extremely troubled,&mdash;&ldquo;very bad luck, this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then I bought, and so made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey?&nbsp; What sent you doing that, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I heard that was your line, and so concluded that you meant 
long instead of short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; croaked Vanderbilt <i>p&egrave;re</i>, as he 
buttoned up his fur overcoat, and stalked out of the open door.&nbsp; He 
has always had a high opinion of William since that event!</p>
<p>Some years ago Vanderbilt wanted to consolidate the Hudson River and 
Harlem Railroads, and when the scheme was presented before the Legislature 
of New York, secured a sufficient number of votes in that body to insure 
the passage of the bill authorizing the consolidation.&nbsp; Before the 
bill was called upon its final passage, however, he learned from a 
trustworthy source that the members of the Legislature who had promised to 
vote for the bill, were determined to vote against it, with the hope of 
ruining him.&nbsp; The stock of the Harlem road was then selling very high,
in consequence of the expected consolidation.&nbsp; The defeat of the bill 
would, of course, cause it to fall immediately.&nbsp; The unprincipled 
legislators at once began a shrewd game.&nbsp; They sold Harlem right and 
left, to be delivered at a future day, and found plenty of purchasers, 
every one but those in the plot expecting the consolidation of the roads 
and a consequent advance in the value of the stock.&nbsp; They let their 
friends into the secret, and there was soon a great deal of &ldquo;selling 
short&rdquo; in this stock.&nbsp; Commodore Vanderbilt managed to acquaint 
himself with the whole plot; but he held his peace, and resolved upon 
revenge.&nbsp; He went into the market quietly, with all the funds he could
raise, and bought every certificate of Harlem stock that he could 
find.&nbsp; These certificates he locked up in his safe.&nbsp; When the 
bill came before the Legislature on its final passage, it was defeated.</p>
<p>The conspirators were jubilant.&nbsp; They were sure that the defeat of 
the bill would bring &ldquo;Harlem&rdquo; down with a rush.&nbsp; To their 
astonishment, however, &ldquo;Harlem&rdquo; did not fall.&nbsp; It remained
stationary the first day, and then to their dismay rose <!-- page 287--><a 
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>steadily.&nbsp; Those
to whom they had sold demanded the delivery of the stock, but the 
speculators found it impossible to buy it.&nbsp; There was none in the 
market at any price.&nbsp; In many of these instances Vanderbilt was the 
real claimant, the brokers acting in the transactions being merely his 
agents.&nbsp; Being unable to deliver the stock, the conspirators were 
forced to settle the demands against them in money, and the result was that
they were ruined.&nbsp; One of the shrewdest operators in New York lost 
over $200,000.&nbsp; He refused to pay, and his name was stricken from the 
list of stockholders.&nbsp; This brought him to his senses, and he made 
good his contracts.&nbsp; Vanderbilt made money enough out of this 
transaction to pay for all the stock he owned in the Harlem Road.</p>
<p>Daniel Drew is a great operator.&nbsp; His gains are immense, as are 
also his losses.&nbsp; He is not popular in the street, and the brokers are
fond of abusing him.&nbsp; He has handled too many of them mercilessly to 
have many friends.&nbsp; They say that he does not hesitate to sacrifice a 
friend to gain his ends, and that he is utterly without sympathy for those 
who go down before his heavy blows.</p>
<p>Bogus stock companies appear from time to time in Wall street.&nbsp; An 
office is rented and fitted up in magnificent style, a flaring programme is
issued, and seemingly substantial evidences of the stability and prosperity
of the company are exhibited to inquirers.&nbsp; The stock offered is 
readily taken up by the eager to be rich crowd.&nbsp; A dividend, most 
hopefully large, is declared and paid, to stimulate investments, and then, 
when the market has been drained dry, the bubble bursts, the directors 
disappear, the office is closed, and the shareholders lose their money.</p>
<p>On fine afternoons visitors to the Park do not fail to notice a handsome
equipage driven by a stylish young man, with rosy cheeks and light curly 
hair.&nbsp; His face is the perfect picture of happy innocence.&nbsp; He is
very wealthy, and owns a great deal of real estate in the city.&nbsp; The 
manner in which he made his money will show how other persons enrich 
themselves.</p>
<p><!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
288</span>A few years ago, he, in company with several others, organized a 
scheme for working certain gold mines said to be located in a distant 
territory.&nbsp; A company was made up, the country was flooded with 
flaming descriptions of the valuable mine, and stock was issued which sold 
readily.&nbsp; The bonds were soon taken up, and in a month or two the 
so-called company commenced paying handsome dividends.&nbsp; A number of 
gold bars, bearing the stamp of the mint, were on exhibition in the 
company&rsquo;s office, and were triumphantly exhibited as amongst the 
first yields of the valuable mine.&nbsp; For several months the dividends 
were paid regularly, and the company&rsquo;s stock rose to a splendid 
premium.&nbsp; It could hardly be bought at any price.&nbsp; No one doubted
for an instant the genuineness of the affair, and the lucky company was the
envy of all Wall street.</p>
<p>In a few months, all the stock being disposed of, the company ceased 
paying dividends.&nbsp; This excited the suspicion of some of the shrewdest
holders of the stock, and the affair was investigated.&nbsp; It was found 
that the wonderful mine had no real existence.&nbsp; The gold bars were 
simply gold coins melted into that form at the Mint, and stamped by the 
Government as so much bullion.&nbsp; The dividends had been paid out of 
money advanced by the company, who were simply half a dozen unprincipled 
sharpers.&nbsp; The stockholders were ruined, but the company made a profit
of a clear half million of dollars out of the infamous transaction.&nbsp; 
Legal proceedings are expensive and tedious when instituted against such 
parties, and the stockholders, rather than increase their losses by the 
outlay necessary for a lawsuit, suffered the swindlers to go 
unmolested.</p>
<p>A certain stock broker, anxious to increase his wealth, purchased twenty
acres of land a few years ago in one of the Western States, and commenced 
boring for oil.&nbsp; After a few weeks spent in this work, he discovered 
to his dismay that there was not the slightest trace of oil on his 
land.&nbsp; He kept his own counsel, however, and paid the workmen to hold 
their tongues.&nbsp; About the same time it became rumored throughout New 
York that he had struck oil.&nbsp; He at once organized a company, and had 
a committee appointed to go West and examine the well.&nbsp; <!-- page 
289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>In a few 
weeks the committee returned in high glee, and reported that the well 
contained oil of the very best quality, and only needed capital and 
improved machinery to develop its capacity.&nbsp; In support of this 
assertion, they brought home numerous bottles containing specimens of the 
oil.&nbsp; This report settled the matter in Wall street, and the stock 
issued by the company was all sold at a handsome premium.&nbsp; When the 
sales ceased, it was rumored that the well had ceased to flow.&nbsp; This 
was true, for there was no oil anywhere on the land.&nbsp; That in the well
had been bought in Pennsylvania, and poured into the well by the agents of 
the owner, and the examining committee had been paid large sums for their 
favorable report.&nbsp; The owner of the well was enriched, as were his 
confederates of the bogus company, and the holders of the stock were 
swindled, many of them being ruined.</p>
<p>Said the New York <i>Herald</i>, at a period when speculation was 
rampant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within the past few days we have seen the most gigantic swindling
operations carried on in Wall street that have as yet disgraced our 
financial centre.&nbsp; A great railway, one of the two that connect the 
West with the Atlantic seaboard, has been tossed about like a football, its
real stockholders have seen their property abused by men to whom they have 
entrusted its interests, and who, in the betrayal of that trust, have 
committed crimes which in parallel cases on a smaller scale would have 
deservedly sent them to Sing Sing.&nbsp; If these parties go unwhipped of 
justice, then are we doing injustice in confining criminals in our State 
prisons for smaller crimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To such a disgusting degree of depravity do we see these stock 
operations carried, that members of the church of high standing offer, when
&lsquo;concerned,&rsquo; to betray their brother &lsquo;pals,&rsquo; and, 
in their forgetfulness of the morality to which they sanctimoniously listen
every Sunday, state that &lsquo;all they care about is to look out for 
number one.&rsquo;&nbsp; A manager of a great corporation is requested to 
issue bonds of his company without authority, offering &lsquo;to buy the 
bonds if you are caught, or buy the bonds with the understanding not to pay
for them unless you are <!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>caught.&rsquo;&nbsp; This attempted fiscal 
operation, however, did not work, and resulted in a good proof of the old 
adage that it requires &lsquo;a rogue to catch a rogue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A railroad treasurer boldly states that he has without authority 
over-issued stock of the company to a large amount.&nbsp; He offers it to a
broker for sale, with the understanding that all received over a fixed 
value is to go into his (the treasurer&rsquo;s) pocket.&nbsp; From the fact
that this man is not arrested for maladministration of the company&rsquo;s 
property, we judge this to be a legitimate operation, and that this may 
hereafter serve as a model or standard of morals to all presidents, 
directors, treasurers and managers of railway and other great 
corporations.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IX.&nbsp; BLACK FRIDAY.</h3>
<p>In the month of September, 1869, one of the most gigantic attempts to 
run up the value of gold ever made was attempted by a powerful combination 
of Bulls, consisting of a set of unprincipled men whose only object was to 
make money.&nbsp; Their scheme came near attaining a success which would 
have broken the market utterly, have unsettled values of all kinds, and 
have precipitated upon the whole country a financial crisis of the most 
terrible proportions.&nbsp; Nothing but the interference of the Secretary 
of the Treasury at a critical moment averted this disaster.&nbsp; As it 
was, the losses were fearful.&nbsp; Men in Wall street were ruined by the 
score, and for several days the best houses in the street were uncertain as
to their exact condition.</p>
<p>An account of this formidable transaction is interesting as revealing 
the method of conducting the great operations of the street.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="SCENE IN THE GOLD ROOM&mdash;BLACK FRIDAY." src="images/p291.jpg"

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 22d of September, 1869, gold stood at 137&frac12; when 
Trinity bells rang out the hour of twelve.&nbsp; By two it was at 
139.&nbsp; Before night its lowest quotation was 141. . . . An advance of 
three and a half per cent. in five hours.&nbsp; At the same time the Stock 
Market exhibited tokens of excessive febrility, <!-- page 292--><a 
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>New York Central 
dropping twenty-three per cent. and Harlem thirteen.&nbsp; Loans had become
extremely difficult to negotiate.&nbsp; The most usurious prices for a 
twenty-four hours&rsquo; turn were freely paid.&nbsp; The storm was 
palpably reaching the proportions of a tempest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, the brokers on the Bear side strove manfully under 
their burden.&nbsp; The character and purposes of the clique were fully 
known.&nbsp; Whatever of mystery had heretofore enfolded them was now 
boldly thrown aside, and the men of Erie, with the sublime Fisk in the 
forefront of the assailing column, assured the shorts that they could not 
settle too quickly, since it remained with the ring, now holding calls for 
one hundred millions, either to kindly compromise at 150 or to carry the 
metal to 200 and nail it there.&nbsp; This threat was accompanied by 
consequences in which the mailed hand revealed itself under the silken 
glove.&nbsp; The movement had intertwisted itself deep into the affairs of 
every dealer in the street, and entangled in its meshes vast numbers of 
outside speculators.&nbsp; In borrowing or in margins the entire capital of
the former had been nearly absorbed, while some five millions had been 
deposited by the latter with their brokers in answer to repeated 
calls.&nbsp; When Thursday morning rose, gold started at 141-5/8, and soon 
shot up to 144.&nbsp; Then the clique began to tighten the screws.&nbsp; 
The shorts received peremptory orders to increase their borrowing 
margins.&nbsp; At the same moment the terms of loans overnight were raised 
beyond the pitch of ordinary human endurance.&nbsp; Stories were 
insidiously circulated exciting suspicion of the integrity of the 
Administration, and strengthening the belief that the National Treasury 
would bring no help to the wounded Bears.&nbsp; Whispers of an impending 
lock-up of money were prevalent; and the fact, then shrewdly suspected, and
now known, of certifications of checks to the amount of twenty-five 
millions by one bank alone on that day, lent color to the rumor.&nbsp; Many
brokers lost courage, and settled instantly.&nbsp; The Gold Room shook with
the conflict, and the battle prolonged itself into a midnight session at 
the Fifth Avenue Hotel.&nbsp; The din of the tumult had penetrated to the 
upper chambers of journalism.&nbsp; <!-- page 293--><a 
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>Reporters were on the
alert.&nbsp; The great dailies magnified the struggle, and the Associated 
Press spread intelligence of the excitement to remote sections.&nbsp; When 
Friday opened clear and calm, the pavement of Broad and New streets soon 
filled up with unwonted visitors.&nbsp; All the idle population of the city
and its neighborhood crowded into the financial quarter to witness the 
throes of the tortured shorts.&nbsp; Blended with the merely curious were 
hundreds of outside speculators who had ventured their all in the great 
stake, and trembled in doubt of the honor of their dealers.&nbsp; Long 
before 9 A.M. these men, intensely interested in the day&rsquo;s encounter,
poured through the alley-way from Broad street, and between the narrow 
walls of New street, surging up around the doorways, and piling themselves 
densely and painfully within the cramped galleries of the Room 
itself.&nbsp; They had made good the fresh calls for margins up to 143, the
closing figure of the night before.&nbsp; The paramount question now was, 
How would gold open?&nbsp; They had not many minutes to wait.&nbsp; 
Pressing up to the fountain, around which some fifty brokers had already 
congregated, a Bull operator with resonant voice bid 145 for twenty 
thousand.&nbsp; The shout startled the galleries.&nbsp; Their margins were 
once more in jeopardy.&nbsp; Would their brokers remain firm?&nbsp; It was 
a terrible moment.&nbsp; The Bears closed round the aggressors.&nbsp; Yells
and shrieks filled the air.&nbsp; A confused and baffling whirl of sounds 
ensued, in which all sorts of fractional bids and offers mingled, till 
&rsquo;46 emerged from the chaos.&nbsp; The crowd within the arena 
increased rapidly in numbers.&nbsp; The clique agents became 
vociferous.&nbsp; Gold steadily pushed forward in its perilous upward 
movement from &rsquo;46 to &rsquo;47, thence to &rsquo;49, and, pausing for
a brief twenty minutes, dashed on to 150&frac12;.&nbsp; It was now 
considerably past the hour of regular session.&nbsp; The President was in 
the chair.&nbsp; The Secretary&rsquo;s pen was bounding over his registry 
book.&nbsp; The floor of the Gold Room was covered with 300 agitated 
dealers and operators, shouting, heaving in masses against and around the 
iron railing of the fountain, falling back upon the approaches of the 
committee-rooms and the outer entrance, guarded with rigorous care by 
sturdy door-keepers.&nbsp; Many of the principal <!-- page 294--><a 
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>brokers of the street
were there,&mdash;Kimber, who had turned traitor to the ring; Colgate, the 
Baptist; Clews, a veteran government broker; one of the Marvins; James 
Brown; Albert Speyer, and dozens of others hardly less famous.&nbsp; Every 
individual of all that seething throng had a personal stake beyond, and, in
natural human estimate, a thousand-fold more dear than that of any outside 
patron, no matter how deeply or ruinously that patron might be 
involved.&nbsp; At 11 of the dial gold was 150&frac12;; in six minutes it 
jumped to 155.&nbsp; Then the pent-up tiger spirit burst from 
control.&nbsp; The arena rocked as the Coliseum may have rocked when the 
gates of the wild beasts were thrown open, and with wails and shrieks the 
captives of the empire sprang to merciless encounter with the ravenous 
demons of the desert.&nbsp; The storm of voices lost human semblance.&nbsp;
Clenched hands, livid faces, pallid foreheads on which beads of cold sweat 
told of the interior anguish, lurid, passion-fired eyes,&mdash;all the 
symptoms of a fever which at any moment might become frenzy were 
there.&nbsp; The shouts of golden millions upon millions hurtled in all 
ears.&nbsp; The labor of years was disappearing and reappearing in the wave
line of advancing and receding prices.&nbsp; With fortunes melting away in 
a second, with five hundred millions of gold in process of sale or 
purchase, with the terror of yet higher prices, and the exultation which 
came and went with the whispers of fresh men entering from Broad street 
bearing confused rumors of the probable interposition of the Government, it
is not hard to understand how reason faltered on its throne, and operators 
became reckless, buying or selling without thought of the morrow or 
consciousness of the present.&nbsp; Then came the terrific bid of Albert 
Speyer for any number of millions at 160.&nbsp; William Parks sold 
instantly two millions and a half in one lot.&nbsp; Yet the bids so far 
from yielding rose to 161, 162, 162&frac12;.&nbsp; For five minutes the 
Board reeled under the ferocity of the attack.&nbsp; Seconds became 
hours.&nbsp; The agony of Wellington awaiting Blucher was in the souls of 
the Bears.&nbsp; Then a broker, reported to be acting for Baring &amp; 
Brothers, at London, sold five millions to the clique at the top price of 
the day.&nbsp; Hallgarten followed; and as the shorts were gathering 
courage, the certain <!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>news that the Secretary of the Treasury had 
come to the rescue swept through the chamber, gold fell from 160 to 140, 
and thence, with hardly the interval of one quotation, to 133.&nbsp; The 
end had come, and the exhausted operators streamed out of the stifling hall
into the fresh air of the street.&nbsp; To them, however, came no 
peace.&nbsp; In some offices customers by dozens, whose margins were 
irrevocably burnt away in the smelting-furnace of the Gold Board, 
confronted their dealers with taunts and threats of violence for their 
treachery.&nbsp; In others the nucleus of mobs began to form, and, as the 
day wore off, Broad street had the aspect of a riot.&nbsp; Huge masses of 
men gathered before the doorway of Smith, Gould, Martin &amp; Co., and 
Heath &amp; Co.&nbsp; Fisk was assaulted, and his life threatened.&nbsp; 
Deputy-sheriffs and police officers appeared on the scene.&nbsp; In 
Brooklyn a company of troops were held in readiness to march upon Wall 
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When night came, Broad street and its vicinity saw an unwonted 
sight.&nbsp; The silence and the darkness which ever rests over the lower 
city after seven of the evening, was broken by the blaze of gas-light from 
a hundred windows, and the footfall of clerks hurrying from a hasty repast 
back to their desks.&nbsp; Until long after Trinity bells pealed out the 
dawn of a new day, men bent over their books, scrutinized the 
Clearing-House statement for the morrow, took what thought was possible for
the future.&nbsp; At the Gold Exchange Bank the weary accountants were 
making ineffective efforts to complete Thursday&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; 
That toilful midnight, at the close of the last great passion-day of the 
bullion-worshippers, will be ever memorable for its anxieties and 
unsatisfying anguish.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p296.jpg">
<img alt="BROAD STREET ON BLACK FRIDAY." src="images/p296.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Saturday brought no relief.&nbsp; The Gold Board met only to 
adjourn, as the Clearing-House had been incapable of the task of settling 
its accounts, complicated as they were by ever fresh failures.&nbsp; The 
small brokers had gone under by scores.&nbsp; The rumors of the impending 
suspension of some of the largest houses of the street gave fresh grounds 
for fear.&nbsp; The Stock Exchange was now the centre of attraction.&nbsp; 
If that yielded, all was lost.&nbsp; To sustain the market was vital.&nbsp;
But whence was the saving power to came?&nbsp; All through yesterday shares
<!-- page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
296</span>had been falling headlong.&nbsp; New York Central careened to 
148, and then recovered to 185&frac34;.&nbsp; Hudson plunged from 173 to 
145.&nbsp; Pittsburgh fell to 68.&nbsp; Northwest reached 62&frac12;.&nbsp;
The shrinkage throughout all securities had been not less than thirty 
millions.&nbsp; Would the impulse downward continue?&nbsp; The throngs 
which filled the corridors and overhung the stairway from which one can 
look down upon the Long Room saw only mad tumult, heard only the roar of 
the biddings.&nbsp; For any certain knowledge they might have been in 
Alaska.&nbsp; But the financial public in the quiet of their offices, and 
nervously scrutinizing the prices <!-- page 297--><a 
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>reeled off from the 
automaton telegraph, saw that Vanderbilt was supporting the New York 
stocks, and that the weakness in other shares was not sufficient to shadow 
forth panic.&nbsp; It soon became known that the capitalists from 
Philadelphia, Boston, and the great Western cities had thrown themselves 
into the breach, and were earning fortunes for themselves as well as 
gratitude from the money-market, by the judicious daring of their 
purchases.&nbsp; The consciousness of this new element was quieting, but 
Wall street was still too feverish to be reposed by any ordinary 
anodyne.&nbsp; A run on the Tenth National Bank had commenced, and all day 
long a steady line of dealers filed up to the counter of the paying teller 
demanding their balances.&nbsp; The courage and the ability in withstanding
the attack which were shown by the president and his associates deserve 
something more than praise.&nbsp; The Gold Exchange Bank witnessed a 
similar scene, angry brokers assaulting the clerks and threatening all 
possible things unless instantaneous settlements were made.&nbsp; The 
freedom with which the press had given details of the explosion had been 
extremely hurtful to the credit of many of the best houses.&nbsp; In a 
crisis like that of Black Friday the sluice-gates of passion open.&nbsp; 
Cloaked in the masquerade of genuine distrust, came forth whispers whose 
only origin was in ancient enmities, long-treasured spites, the soundless 
depths of unquenchable malignities.&nbsp; Firms of staunchest reputation 
felt the rapier-stroke of old angers.&nbsp; The knowledge that certain 
houses were large holders of particular stocks was the signal of attacks 
upon the shares.&nbsp; Despite of outside orders for vast amounts, these 
influences had their effect upon securities, and aided to tighten the loan 
market.&nbsp; One, one and a half, two, and even four per cent. were the 
compulsory terms on which money could alone be borrowed to carry stocks 
over Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Monday the 27th the Gold Board met, but only to be informed 
that the Clearing-House was not yet ready to complete the work of 
Friday.&nbsp; Important accounts had been kept back, and the dealings, 
swollen in sum-total to five hundred millions, were beyond the capacity of 
the clerical force of the Gold Bank to grapple with.&nbsp; A resolution was
brought forward <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>proposing the resumption of operations 
Ex-Clearing-House.&nbsp; The measure took the members by surprise, for a 
moment quivered between acceptance and rejection, and then was swiftly 
tabled.&nbsp; It was an immense Bear scheme, for no exchange can transact 
business where its dealers are under suspicion.&nbsp; All outstanding 
accounts require immediate fulfilment.&nbsp; Failure to make good 
deliveries would have insured the instant selling out of defaulters 
&lsquo;under the rule.&rsquo;&nbsp; As the majority of brokers were 
inextricably involved in the late difficulty, the only consequence would 
have been to throw them into bankruptcy, thus bringing some $60,000,000 
under the hammer.&nbsp; The market could not have borne up under such an 
avalanche.&nbsp; It was decided that the Room should be kept open for 
borrowings and loans, but that all dealings should be suspended.&nbsp; One 
result of this complication was that gold had no fixed value.&nbsp; It 
could be bought at one house for 133 and at other offices sold for 
139.&nbsp; The Board thus proved its utility at the very juncture when 
least in favor.&rdquo;</p>

299</span>XVI.&nbsp; THE FERRIES.</h2>
<p>Including the Harlem, Staten Island, and Elizabethport routes, there are
about twenty-five lines of ferries plying between New York and the adjacent
shores.&nbsp; Ten of these lines are to Brooklyn, two to Hunter&rsquo;s 
Point, two to Green Point, one to Mott Haven, and one to Harlem, all in the
East River; and five to Jersey City, one to Weehawken, one to Fort Lee, two
to Staten Island, and one to Elizabethport, all in the North River.&nbsp; 
Thus there are sixteen lines in the East River, and ten in the North 
River.&nbsp; The boats are large side-wheel vessels, capable of carrying 
pedestrians, horses and vehicles.&nbsp; The fare to the Jersey shore is 
three cents, to Brooklyn two, and to Harlem and Staten Island ten 
cents.&nbsp; On some of the lines the boats ply every five minutes; on 
others the intervals are longer.&nbsp; The Staten Island and Harlem boats 
start every hour.</p>
<p>The boats are generally handsome, as well as large.&nbsp; Nearly all are
lighted with gas, and at least a score of them are to be seen in the stream
at any time.&nbsp; At night, with their many colored lamps, they give to 
the river quite a gala appearance.&nbsp; The Fulton, Barclay, and 
Courtlandt street lines run their boats all night.&nbsp; The others run 
from 4 A.M. until midnight.&nbsp; The travel on the various lines is 
immense.&nbsp; The aggregate is said, by reliable authority, to be upwards 
of 200,000 persons per day, or about 75,000,000 per annum.&nbsp; Many of 
the boats carry from 800 to 1000 passengers at a single trip.</p>
<p>During the summer it is pleasant enough to cross either of the rivers 
which encircle the island, but in the winter such travelling is very 
dangerous.&nbsp; Storms of snow, fogs, and floating ice interfere very 
greatly with the running of the boats, and <!-- page 300--><a 
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>render accidents 
imminent.&nbsp; Collisions are frequent during rough or thick weather, and 
the ice sometimes sweeps the boats for miles out of their course.&nbsp; The
East River is always more or less crowded with vessels of all kinds, either
in motion or at anchor, and even in fair weather it requires the greatest 
skill on the part of the pilot to avoid collisions.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people enter and leave the great city daily by 
means of the ferries.&nbsp; The country for twenty miles around the city is
built up by persons who earn their bread in New York, and morning and 
evening they pass between their places of business and their homes.&nbsp; 
You may recognize them as they come into the city in the morning, or as 
they leave it at the close of the day.&nbsp; Towards five o&rsquo;clock 
vast swarms of working-men pour over the river, followed at six and seven 
by the factory and shop girls, the clerks and salesmen in the retail houses
and offices, and from these the newsboys reap a harvest for the two-penny 
papers.&nbsp; Every one has his newspaper, and all who can find the 
necessary space on the ferry-boat economize their time by reading the news 
as they cross the river.&nbsp; Later still come the clerks in the wholesale
houses, and later still the great merchants themselves.&nbsp; Between nine 
and ten the Wall street men put in an appearance, and later yet the great 
capitalists, residing out of the city, begin to show themselves.&nbsp; From
eight o&rsquo;clock the great dailies are in demand, and the newsboys have 
scarcely a call for the cheap papers.&nbsp; Towards noon the idlers and 
ladies bent on shopping expeditions cross over, and for a few hours the 
ferries are comparatively dull.&nbsp; Towards four o&rsquo;clock in the 
afternoon, however, the tide flows back again, but in reverse order.&nbsp; 
The richest come first, for their working hours are short, and the poorest 
extend the crowd into the hours of darkness.&nbsp; Night brings another 
flow and ebb of pleasure-seekers, theatre-goers, etc., so that the midnight
boats go almost as full as those of the early evening.&nbsp; Then a few 
stragglers avail themselves of the boats that ply between midnight and 
morning.&nbsp; They are mostly journalists, actors, or printers employed in
the newspaper offices.</p>
<p>With the first light of dawn, and frequently long before the <!-- page 
301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>darkness has
passed away, the market farmers and gardeners of Long Island and New Jersey
crowd the boats with their huge wagons heavily loaded with vegetables and 
fruits for the city markets.&nbsp; They come in throngs, and the approaches
to the ferries in Brooklyn and Jersey City are lined for blocks with their 
wagons.&nbsp; They are mostly Germans, but they show a decidedly American 
quality in the impatience they manifest at the delays to which they are 
subjected.&nbsp; On the lower Jersey ferries, they are often followed by 
droves of cattle, many of which have come from the Far West, all wending 
their way to the slaughter houses of New York.</p>
<p>The New York approaches to the ferries are always &ldquo;jammed&rdquo; 
with wagons and trucks.&nbsp; The luckless &ldquo;foot-passenger&rdquo; 
must take the chances of reaching the boat in time, and often must incur no
little risk in making his way through the crowd of vehicles.&nbsp; The 
police try hard to keep these approaches free, but the throng is too great 
for them, and they have all they can do in seeing after the safety of the 
&ldquo;foot-passengers.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man on foot has no rights that a New
York driver is bound to respect, and Jehu thinks it no harm to run over any
one who gets in his way.</p>
<p>The ferries are good places to study human nature, for all classes use 
them.&nbsp; You see here the poor, pale working girl, whom toil and poverty
are making prematurely old, and the blooming lady of fashion; the beggar 
and the millionaire; the honest laborer and the thief; the virtuous mother 
and her children, and the brazen courtezan and her poodle dog.&nbsp; You 
can tell them all by their appearance and aspect, for here they enjoy a few
moments of enforced idleness, and during that time they are natural in 
expression and attitude.</p>
<p>At night, the scene to be witnessed from these boats is very 
striking.&nbsp; The waters are dark and the current is strong, and the dash
of the waves against the side of the boat is like the noise of the great 
ocean.&nbsp; Through the darkness you may dimly discern the stern outline 
of the cities on either side, with the forests of masts which line them 
rising from the dark hulls at the piers.&nbsp; The shadowy forms of vessels
at anchor in the <!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>stream, each with its warning light, rise up 
and disappear as if by magic as you dart past them.&nbsp; On the shore the 
many colored lights mark the various ferry houses, and similar lights are 
flashing about the stream like fire-flies as the boats pass from shore to 
shore.&nbsp; Back of the ferry houses the long rows of lights in the cities
stretch away into the distance, and high over all gleams the round white 
face of the illuminated clock on the City Hall in New York.&nbsp; The 
breeze is fresh and keen, and comes in laden with the sighing of the mighty
ocean so near at hand.</p>
<p>The people standing out on the open deck are silent, impressed by the 
fascination of the scene.&nbsp; Hark! there is a splash at the side of the 
boat, a white figure gleams one moment on the crest of the waves, and then 
sinks under the dark waters.&nbsp; The bell strikes sharply, and the boat 
stops suddenly.&nbsp; Life-preservers are thrown overboard, and lights 
gleam along the side of the boat.&nbsp; There is no sign of the unfortunate
girl who has so rashly sought peace, and the waters will hold her in their 
cold embrace till the sea gives up its dead.&nbsp; All search is hopeless, 
and the boat speeds on, a dumb horror holding its occupants mute.</p>
<p>In a fog, the scene is exciting beyond description.&nbsp; The passengers
throng the forward end of the boat, and strive with eager eyes to pierce 
the dense mist which enshrouds the stream and hides the shore from 
view.&nbsp; From either side the hoarse clangor of the ferry bells, tolling
their number, comes floating through the mist, to guide the pilot to his 
destination, and all around, on every hand, steamers are shrieking their 
shrill signals to each other.&nbsp; The boat moves slowly and with caution,
and the pilot strains both eye and ear to keep her in the right 
course.&nbsp; One single error of judgment on his part, and the boat might 
go crashing into a similar steamer, or into one of the vessels lying in the
stream.&nbsp; It is a moment of danger, and those who are used to the river
know it.&nbsp; You could hear a pin drop in the silent crowd on the 
deck.&nbsp; If men speak at all, they do so in low, subdued tones.&nbsp; 
There is a sharp whistle on the right, and the boat suddenly stops.&nbsp; 
You hear the splashing of paddle <!-- page 303--><a 
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>wheels, and the next 
moment a huge steamer dashes past you in the mist.&nbsp; You can hear her, 
but the fog hides her.&nbsp; Then the boat goes ahead again, and gradually 
the fog bells on the shore grow louder and clearer, and in a little while 
the dock bursts suddenly upon you, so spectral and unearthly in its 
appearance that you hardly recognize it.&nbsp; The boat now glides swiftly 
into her &ldquo;slip,&rdquo; and a sigh of relief breaks from the throng on
board.&nbsp; The danger is over.</p>
<p>The boats carry such crowds that an accident to any of them is a 
terrible affair.&nbsp; The collision at the Fulton Ferry in 1868, and the 
terrible explosion of the Westfield in 1871, were attended with great loss 
of life.&nbsp; The injuries were none of them slight, and the disasters 
were of such magnitude as to throw a general gloom over the community.</p>
<h2><!-- page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
304</span>XVII.&nbsp; THE HOTELS.</h2>
<p>New York is the paradise of hotels.&nbsp; In no other city do they 
flourish in such numbers, and nowhere else do they attain such a degree of 
excellence.&nbsp; The hotels of New York naturally take the lead of all 
others in America, and are regarded by all who have visited them as models 
of their kind.</p>
<p>It is said that there are from six to seven hundred hotels of all kinds 
in the City of New York.&nbsp; These afford accommodations for persons of 
every class, and are more or less expensive, according to the means of 
their guests.&nbsp; Of these, only about fifty are well known, even in the 
city, and only about twenty-five come under the head of 
&ldquo;fashionable.&rdquo;&nbsp; The principal hotels are, beginning down 
town, the Astor, St. Nicholas, Metropolitan, Grand Central, Brevoort, New 
York, St. Denis, Spingler, Everett, Clarendon, Westminster, Glenham, Fifth 
Avenue, Hoffman, Albemarle, St. James, Coleman, Sturtevant, Gilsey, Grand, 
and St. Cloud.&nbsp; These are the largest, handsomest, and best kept 
houses in the city.&nbsp; Each has its characteristics and its special 
customers, and each in its way is worth studying.</p>
<p>The <i>Astor House</i> is one of the oldest hotels in the city.&nbsp; It
is built of granite, and occupies an entire block on Broadway, from Vesey 
to Barclay streets.&nbsp; It is immediately opposite the <i>Herald</i> 
office, and the new Post-office.&nbsp; It was built by John Jacob Astor, 
and presented by him to his son William.&nbsp; It was opened for business 
in 1831, by Colonel Charles A. Stetson, the present proprietor, and for 
twenty years was the leading hotel of the country.&nbsp; In those days no 
one had seen New York unless he had &ldquo;put up at the 
Astor.&rdquo;&nbsp; People talked of it all over <!-- page 305--><a 
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>the country, and in 
all our leading cities monster hotels began to appear, modelled upon the 
same general plan.&nbsp; Those were the palmy days of the Astor, and if one
could write their history in full, it would be a record worth 
reading.&nbsp; The old registers of the house would be valuable for the 
autographs they contain, for there was scarcely a great or distinguished 
man of those days but had written his name in Colonel Stetson&rsquo;s 
book.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p305.jpg">
<img alt="THE ASTOR HOUSE." src="images/p305.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The house had from the first a strong flavor of politics about it.&nbsp;
The leading statesmen of the country were always there in greater or less 
force, and their admirers kept up a continuous throng of comers and 
goers.&nbsp; The house had a decided leaning towards the Whig Party, and 
finally it became their New York headquarters.&nbsp; For thirty years 
Thurlow Weed boarded here, and the caucuses, committee meetings, and 
intrigues of various kinds the old house has witnessed, would fill a volume
with their history.&nbsp; The Astor still keeps its political character, 
and <!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
306</span>is one of the Republican strongholds of the city.&nbsp; It is 
safe to assert that very few Democrats now inscribe their names on its 
register, if they are free to seek quarters elsewhere.</p>
<p>The misfortune of the Astor is that it is too far down town to be a 
fashionable house.&nbsp; It is admirably located for merchants and others 
who have business in the lower part of the city, and to whom time is of 
value.&nbsp; A few old-time folks, who knew the house in its palmy days, 
still stop there, and many whose political faith is in sympathy with that 
of the proprietor, make it a matter of conscience to patronize the house, 
and Colonel Stetson&rsquo;s well-earned popularity brings him other 
guests.&nbsp; Although its glories have faded, the Astor is still a 
successful hotel, but in popularity with the general public, it has long 
since been eclipsed by the <i>up town hotels</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>St. Nicholas</i> is one of the best houses in the city.&nbsp; It 
shows a handsome marble front on Broadway, with a brown stone extension on 
the same thoroughfare to Prince street, and extends back to Mercer 
street.&nbsp; It is handsomely furnished, and is kept on a scale of comfort
and magnificence worthy of its fame.&nbsp; Its spacious halls and 
sitting-rooms, on the street floor, furnish one of the most popular 
lounging places in the city.&nbsp; Towards nightfall they are full to 
overflowing.&nbsp; The table is said, by the lovers of good living, to be 
the best served of any house in the city.&nbsp; The hotel is always full, 
and is very profitable to its proprietors.&nbsp; It is said to pay better 
in proportion to its expenses than any of its rivals.&nbsp; It is much 
liked by the Western people, who come here in crowds.&nbsp; There is also a
dashing element about its guests which gives to it its peculiar reputation 
in the city.&nbsp; It is popularly believed to be the headquarters of 
&ldquo;Shoddy,&rdquo; and certain it is that one sees among its 
habitu&eacute;s an immense number of flashily dressed, loud-voiced, 
self-asserting people.</p>
<p>The <i>Metropolitan</i> is a handsome brown stone edifice, situated at 
the northeast corner of Broadway and Prince street.&nbsp; It extends back 
to Crosby street, and has a frontage of about 300 feet on Broadway.&nbsp; 
It is one of the most elegant hotels in the city, in every respect.&nbsp; 
It contains about 400 rooms, and is <!-- page 307--><a 
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>always full.&nbsp; It
is very popular with army officers, with Californians and the people of the
mining States and Territories, as well as with the New Englanders.&nbsp; 
Capitalists and railroad managers also have a fondness for it.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Shoddy&rdquo; is to be seen here also in great force.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p307.jpg">
<img alt="ST. NICHOLAS HOTEL." src="images/p307.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The <i>New York Hotel</i> is a plain red brick structure, occupying the 
entire block bounded by Broadway and Mercer street, and East Washington and
Waverley Places.&nbsp; It has recently been refitted and improved, and is 
one of the most comfortable houses in the city.&nbsp; In one respect, it 
may be regarded as the counterpart of the Astor, since like that hotel, it 
is noted for its political complexion.&nbsp; It is the favorite stopping 
place of the Democratic politicians visiting the city, and is mainly 
patronized by members of that party.&nbsp; It is very popular with the 
Southern people, large numbers of whom come here to spend the summer, <!-- 
page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>to 
escape from the heat of their climate, or to pass the winter to enjoy the 
delights of the city.&nbsp; The guests of the New York generally stay a 
long time, and the house is said to do a good business.</p>
<p>The <i>Grand Central</i>, on Broadway, between Bleecker and Amity 
streets, and extending back to Mercer street, is a new house.&nbsp; It was 
opened in August, 1870, and is the largest hotel in America.&nbsp; It rises
to a height of eight stories, or 127 feet, exclusive of the Mansard roof, 
above the street.&nbsp; Including the central dome, it is ten stories in 
height.&nbsp; The fitting up of the house is very handsome and elaborate, 
the furniture and decorations having cost over half a million of 
dollars.&nbsp; The dining-room will seat 600 persons at once.</p>
<p>The <i>Fifth Avenue Hotel</i>, at the junction of Broadway and Fifth 
avenue, and between Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth streets, is generally 
regarded as the best house in the city.&nbsp; It occupies the most 
conspicuous location in New York, and is one of the finest buildings of its
kind in the world.&nbsp; It is constructed of white marble, is six stories 
in height, above ground, and fronts on Fifth avenue, Broadway, Twenty-third
and Twenty-fourth streets.&nbsp; The land and building are valued at over 
$1,000,000, and are owned by Mr. Amos R. Eno, by whom the house was 
built.&nbsp; The proprietors are Messrs. Hitchcock, Darling &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The hotel was begun in 1857, Mr. Eno having more faith in the rapid 
growth and prosperity of the city than most persons had at that day.&nbsp; 
The wise heads laughed him to scorn, and called his house 
&ldquo;Eno&rsquo;s folly.&rdquo;&nbsp; They said it might make a popular 
summer resort, but would never take rank as a first class city hotel.&nbsp;
It was too high up town.&nbsp; Undismayed by these criticisms, Mr. Eno went
on with his work, and in 1860, the marble palace, to which he gave the name
of the <i>Fifth Avenue Hotel</i>, was opened to the public.&nbsp; By this 
time the city had grown so fast as to make the need of this house 
imperative, but the first years of the war laid a burden upon it which only
the most skilful financial management could overcome.</p>
<p>The hotel is the most perfectly appointed in the city.&nbsp; The <!-- 
page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>ground 
floor along Broadway and Fifth avenue is let out in stores.&nbsp; The main 
entrance is on Fifth avenue, and is ornamented with a fine marble 
porch.&nbsp; From this, the visitor enters into the spacious reception 
hall, tiled with marble and handsomely frescoed.&nbsp; A marble counter at 
the lower end encloses the offices of the hotel, and on this counter is 
laid the Visitor&rsquo;s Register, of which several fresh pages are filled 
daily with the names of new-comers.&nbsp; Opposite the office are the 
stairs leading to the basement, in which are the billiard-rooms, 
storerooms, etc., of the house.&nbsp; The hall upon which the office opens 
extends through to the rear of the building.&nbsp; On the south side of 
this hall is the reading-room, in which are to be found the daily papers of
the leading cities of the Union.&nbsp; Opposite the reading-room is the 
bar-room, one of the most elegant apartments of the house, and beyond this 
is the handsome and well-appointed barber-shop.&nbsp; There is a private 
entrance on Twenty-fourth street, used mainly by gentlemen, another on 
Twenty-third street, and still another on Broadway.&nbsp; Each is in charge
of a door-keeper, whose duty it is to exclude improper personages.&nbsp; 
Along the Twenty-third street side are suites of private apartments on the 
ground floor, occupied by permanent boarders.</p>
<p>The various floors are reached by means of an &ldquo;elevator,&rdquo; 
the first ever used in this country.&nbsp; Similar arrangements are now in 
use in all the large hotels.&nbsp; The main stairway commences immediately 
opposite the office.&nbsp; It is of white marble, and massive in its 
design.&nbsp; Ascending it the visitor finds himself in a spacious hall, at
one end of which is a corridor at right angles to this hall.&nbsp; At the 
end nearest the stairs is the dining-room, a magnificent apartment.&nbsp; 
When the tables are filled with a handsomely dressed throng of guests at 
the dinner hour, this room presents one of the most brilliant sights that 
can be witnessed on the continent.&nbsp; The bill of fare comprises 
literally everything that is in season.&nbsp; Back of the dining-room is 
the kitchen, an immense establishment.&nbsp; Everything connected with it 
goes on like clock-work, however, so perfect is the system upon which it is
managed.&nbsp; Beneath the kitchen are the machines <!-- page 310--><a 
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>for warming and 
ventilating the hotel.&nbsp; By means of these a perfectly comfortable 
temperature is maintained in all parts of the house, and the smells of the 
kitchen are kept out of the halls and chambers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p310.jpg">
<img alt="FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL." src="images/p310.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At the end of the hall upon which the dining-room opens, are the parlors
of the house.&nbsp; These are among the most magnificent rooms in the 
country.&nbsp; They are furnished with great taste and elegance, and their 
windows look out immediately upon Madison Square.&nbsp; There are also 
several private parlors adjoining the public rooms.&nbsp; Along the 
Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth street sides of the house are corridors, not
quite so wide, but longer than the main corridor, and leading off from 
it.&nbsp; The three constitute one of the pleasantest promenades to be 
found.&nbsp; The floors are covered with the richest carpets, into which 
the feet sink noiselessly.&nbsp; In the day a half twilight prevails, and 
at night a rich flood of gaslight streams along their entire length.</p>
<p>The upper floors are occupied with private parlors, rooms for guests, 
etc.&nbsp; There are in this hotel pleasant quarters for 800 persons, and a
greater number can be accommodated in case of <!-- page 311--><a 
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>necessity.&nbsp; 
There are 100 suites of rooms, besides the ordinary chambers.&nbsp; Each 
suite comprises a parlor, chamber, dressing-room, bath-room and 
water-closet.&nbsp; The number of permanent boarders is about 300.&nbsp; 
The transient arrivals average about 300 per day, sometimes amounting to 
about twice that number.&nbsp; The house is expensive, but its 
accommodations are unsurpassed, and if one can &ldquo;get his money 
back&rdquo; anywhere in the city he can at this hotel.</p>
<p>The house is mainly patronized by people from other parts of the State, 
from New England, and from the West.&nbsp; It is the most fashionable 
establishment in the city, and will doubtless hold its present rank as long
as its energetic proprietors retain the control of it.</p>
<p>Towards eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the hotel presents its most 
attractive features.&nbsp; It is full to overflowing.&nbsp; The lower 
halls, the reading and sitting-rooms are filled with well-dressed men, 
guests and citizens, who have sauntered here from all parts of the 
city.&nbsp; Four-fifths are smoking, and the air is hazy with the 
&ldquo;vapor of the weed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hum of conversation is 
incessant, but the general tone is well-bred and courteous.&nbsp; In the 
farther end of the great hall a group of stock brokers may be seen 
comparing notes, and making bargains for the sale and purchase of their 
fickle wares.&nbsp; The clink of glasses makes music in the bar-room, and 
beyond this you may see the barbers at work on their customers in the 
luxurious shaving saloon.&nbsp; Doors are opening and shutting continually,
people are coming and going.&nbsp; Porters are pushing their way through 
the crowd bearing huge trunks on their shoulders.&nbsp; The office bell is 
sounding incessantly, from a dozen different chambers at once, and the 
servants are moving about in every direction to execute the orders of the 
guests.</p>
<p>On the floor above the scene is as animated, but of a different 
character.&nbsp; Every one here is in full dinner dress, and all are on 
their good behaviour.&nbsp; The grand dining-room is crowded with guests, 
who are doing ample justice to the sumptuous viands set before them.&nbsp; 
The parlors are thronged with ladies and gentlemen, and the corridors are 
filled with promenaders.&nbsp; The <!-- page 312--><a 
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>toilettes of the 
ladies are magnificent, and they can be seen here to better advantage than 
at any ball or evening party.&nbsp; You may see here some of the loveliest 
and most refined women, and some of the coarsest and vulgarest, some of the
most courtly gentlemen, and some of the most insufferable snobs.&nbsp; If 
you will join the quiet-looking man moving through the throng as if seeking
some one whom he cannot find, he can give you many an interesting bit of 
gossip about the various persons whom you will encounter in your 
walk.&nbsp; He is the detective of the house, and is on the watch for 
improper characters.&nbsp; Well-dressed thieves will make their way into 
hotels in spite of the precautions of the proprietors.&nbsp; Here a guest 
is comparatively safe.&nbsp; The detective is argus-eyed, and knows 
everybody.&nbsp; Let a pick-pocket or thief but show his face in this 
place, and his arrest is sure.&nbsp; All night the corridors are patrolled 
by watchmen to make sure of the safety of the sleeping guests.&nbsp; The 
house is absolutely fire-proof.</p>
<p>The cost of conducting such an establishment is immense, but the profits
are in proportion.&nbsp; The average profit of this house is said to be 
about a quarter of a million of dollars per annum.</p>
<p>The hotels that have been mentioned are all conducted on the American 
plan of full board, or one charge for every expense.&nbsp; This enables a 
guest to calculate his expenses exactly, and has many other advantages.</p>
<p>Many of the most fashionable houses are conducted on what is called 
&ldquo;the European plan,&rdquo; in which a separate charge is made for 
room, meals, and every service rendered.&nbsp; It is said that this is more
economical than the other plan, and that it is less profitable to the 
proprietors.&nbsp; It is adopted by the Hoffman, St. Denis, Glenham, 
Brevoort, Coleman, St. James, Albemarle, Clarendon, Everett, Grand, Gilsey,
and several other prominent houses.</p>
<p>The leading hotels of the city lie very close together, the majority of 
them being in the vicinity of Union and Madison Squares.&nbsp; This is 
found to be an advantage, as strangers find it pleasant to visit friends 
who are staying at other houses.&nbsp; The <!-- page 313--><a 
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>business of hotel 
keeping in New York is generally very profitable.&nbsp; A large outlay is 
required at the opening of the house, for furniture, etc., as much as from 
$200,000 to $500,000 being expended on the fitting up of a first-class 
house.&nbsp; The furniture, plate, etc., of the Fifth Avenue and Grand 
Central Hotels are valued at the latter sum for each establishment.&nbsp; 
If the house meet with success, a moderate sum will suffice to supply its 
current wants.&nbsp; The business is all cash, and large amounts of money 
are received daily.&nbsp; The annual profits of the Fifth Avenue Hotel are 
said to be about $250,000; those of the St. Nicholas about $200,000.&nbsp; 
Other leading houses, when well managed, are said to clear about twenty per
cent. on the sum invested.&nbsp; Large fortunes have been made by not a few
keepers of hotels in New York.</p>
<p>The large hotels depend entirely upon transient guests for their 
success.&nbsp; The city has, perhaps, the largest floating population in 
America.&nbsp; Thousands come and go daily, even in the summer months, and 
these are mostly persons who have money to spend.&nbsp; Bridal parties are 
constantly arriving, and these are not inclined to be the most economical 
in their expenditures.&nbsp; In the spring and fall, the Southern and 
Western merchants come to New York in great numbers to buy goods, and are 
among the best customers of the hotels.&nbsp; Thousands, on business, and 
for pleasure, come and go daily, and they all pour a constant stream of 
money into the coffers of the hotels.</p>
<p>The smaller houses, while they compete with their great rivals for 
transient custom, rely chiefly upon their permanent guests.&nbsp; These are
filled with families who have come to them to avoid the trouble of keeping 
house, and who remain all through the fall, winter, and spring.&nbsp; In 
the summer they go to the watering places, so that they pass their whole 
lives in hotels.&nbsp; They are mostly persons of wealth and fashion.&nbsp;
As may be supposed, the atmosphere of a hotel is not very favorable to 
domestic privacy, and such establishments are vast manufactories of 
scandal.&nbsp; People imagine that they are living privately, but their 
every action is subject to the inspection and comment of the other inmates 
of the house.&nbsp; The hotels are not the safest places for the <!-- page 
314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>growth of 
the domestic virtues.&nbsp; Indeed, it may be said that they furnish the 
best means of destroying them entirely.&nbsp; Neither are they the best 
place for the training of children.&nbsp; This last, however, may be a 
minor consideration, for the wives who live at the hotels seem, as a rule, 
to take care that there shall be no children to need training.&nbsp; Small 
families are a necessity at such places, and they remain small in that 
atmosphere.&nbsp; If another Asmodeus could look down into the hotels of 
New York, he would have some startling revelations to make, which would no 
doubt go far to corroborate the gossip one hears in the city concerning 
them.</p>
<p>The proprietors of the city hotels are very active in their efforts to 
exclude improper characters from their houses, but with all their vigilance
do not always succeed in doing so.&nbsp; One is never certain as to the 
respectability of his neighbor at the table, and it is well to be 
over-cautious in forming acquaintanceships at such places.&nbsp; Impure 
women of the &ldquo;higher,&rdquo; that is the more successful class, and 
gamblers, abound at the hotels.&nbsp; The proprietor cannot turn them out 
unless they are notorious, until they commit some overt act, for fear of 
getting himself into trouble.&nbsp; As soon, however, as his attention is 
called to any improper conduct on their part, they are turned into the 
street, no matter at what hour of the day or night.</p>
<p>Hotel proprietors are also the victims of adventurers of both 
sexes.&nbsp; These people live from house to house, often changing their 
names as fast as they change their quarters, and they are more numerous 
than is generally believed.&nbsp; One man who made himself known to the 
police in this way, used to take his family, consisting of a wife and three
children, to the hotels, and engage the best rooms.&nbsp; When his bill was
presented, he affected to be extremely busy, and promised to attend to it 
the next day.&nbsp; By the next day, however, he had disappeared with his 
family.&nbsp; His trunk, which had been left behind, was found to contain 
nothing but bricks and rags, or paper.</p>
<p>Another adventurer would put up at the most fashionable hotels, and when
requested to pay his bills would feign madness.&nbsp; He would rave, and 
sing, and dance, call himself <!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 315</span>Nebuchadnezzar, or George Washington, or some 
such personage, and completely baffle the detectives, who were for a long 
time inclined to believe him a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> madman.&nbsp; In this
way he ran up a bill of one hundred and seventy-one dollars at the Fifth 
Avenue Hotel, which he never paid.</p>
<p>Others do not seek to obtain lodgings at the hotels, but confine their 
efforts to securing meals without paying for them.&nbsp; They get into the 
dining-rooms along with the crowd at the meal hour, and once in and seated 
at the table are generally safe.&nbsp; Some two years ago as many as 
thirty-four of this class were detected at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in a 
single month.&nbsp; These men as they leave the dining-room generally 
manage to secure a better hat than that they deposited on the stand in 
entering.&nbsp; Under the regime of the Lelands, the Metropolitan Hotel had
a colored man stationed at the door of its dining-room, who proved more 
than a match for the most expert thief.</p>
<p>All first class hotels keep private detectives and watchmen on duty at 
all hours.&nbsp; The business of these men is to keep guard over the upper 
part of the house, to prevent thieves from entering and robbing the rooms 
of the guests.&nbsp; Suspicious persons are at once apprehended, and 
required to give an account of themselves.&nbsp; Some queer mishaps often 
befall guests of the house who are not known to the detectives.</p>
<p>Bold robberies are often effected at the hotels of the city.&nbsp; Some 
time ago a thief was captured at the St. Nicholas, and upon being searched 
a gold watch and chain, and five different parcels of money were found upon
him, all of which were identified by guests as their property.</p>
<h2><!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
316</span>XVIII.&nbsp; IMPOSTORS.</h2>
<p>There is no city in the Union in which impostors of all kinds flourish 
so well as in New York.&nbsp; The immense size of the city, the 
heterogeneous character of its population, and the great variety of the 
interests and pursuits of the people, are all so many advantages to the 
cheat and swindler.&nbsp; It would require a volume to detail the tricks of
these people, and some of their adventures would equal anything to be found
in the annals of romance.&nbsp; All manner of tricks are practised upon the
unsuspecting, and generally the perpetrator escapes without 
punishment.&nbsp; They come here from all parts of the country, and indeed 
from all parts of the world, in the hope of reaping a rich harvest, and the
majority end by eking out a miserable existence in a manner which even the 
police who watch them so closely are sometimes unable to understand.</p>
<p>They find their way into all classes.&nbsp; One cannot mingle much in 
society here without meeting some bewhiskered, mysterious individual, who 
claims to be of noble birth.&nbsp; Sometimes he palms himself off as a 
political exile, sometimes he is travelling, and is so charmed with New 
York that he makes it his headquarters, and sometimes he lets a few friends
into the secret of his rank, and begs that they will not reveal his true 
title, as a little unpleasant affair, a mere social scandal in his own 
country, made it necessary for him to absent himself for a while.&nbsp; He 
hopes the matter will blow over in a few months, and then he will go 
home.&nbsp; The fashionable New-Yorker, male or female, is powerless 
against the charms of aristocracy.&nbsp; The &ldquo;foreign nobleman&rdquo;
is welcomed everywhere, f&ecirc;ted, petted, and allowed almost any 
privilege he chooses to claim&mdash;and he is far from <!-- page 317--><a 
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>being very modest in 
this respect; and by and by he is found out to be an impostor, probably the
valet of some gentleman of rank in Europe.&nbsp; Then society holds up its 
hands in holy horror, and vows it always did suspect him.&nbsp; The men in 
society are weak enough in this respect; but the women are most frequently 
the victims.</p>
<p>Not long since, a handsome, well got up Englishman came to New York on a
brief visit.&nbsp; He called himself Lord Richard X---.&nbsp; Society 
received him with open arms.&nbsp; Invitations were showered upon 
him.&nbsp; Brown&rsquo;s hands were always full of cards for his 
Lordship.&nbsp; The women went wild over him, especially since it was 
whispered that the young man was heir to a property worth ever so many 
millions of pounds.&nbsp; In short, his Lordship found himself so popular, 
and hints of his departure were received with such disfavor by his new 
found friends, that he concluded to extend his stay in New York 
indefinitely.&nbsp; He made a fine show, and his toilettes, turnouts, and 
presents were magnificent.&nbsp; The men did not fancy him.&nbsp; He was 
too haughty and uncivil, but the ladies found him intensely 
agreeable.&nbsp; It was whispered by his male acquaintances that he was a 
good hand at borrowing, and that he was remarkably lucky at cards and at 
the races.&nbsp; One or two of the large faro banks of the city were 
certainly the losers by his visits.&nbsp; The ladies, however, were 
indignant at such stories.&nbsp; His Lordship was divine.&nbsp; All the 
women were crazy after him, and any of them would have taken him at the 
first offer.</p>
<p>By and by the newspapers began to take notice of the young man, and 
boldly asserted that there was no such name as Lord Richard X--- in the 
British peerage.&nbsp; Society laughed at this, and declared that everybody
but ignorant newspaper men was aware that the published lists of titled 
personages in England were notoriously incomplete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his Lordship played his cards well, and it was soon announced
that he was &ldquo;to be married shortly to a well-known belle of Fifth 
avenue.&rdquo;&nbsp; The women were green with jealousy, and the men, I 
think, were not a little relieved to find that the lion did not intend 
devouring all the Fifth avenue <!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>belles.&nbsp; The marriage came off in due 
season; the wedding-presents fairly poured in, and were magnificent.&nbsp; 
The new Lady X--- was at the summit of her felicity, and was the envied of 
all who knew her.&nbsp; The happy pair departed on their honeymoon, but his
Lordship made no effort to return home to England.</p>
<p>During their absence, it leaked out that Lord X--- was an 
impostor.&nbsp; Creditors began to pour in upon his father-in-law with 
anxious inquiries after his Lordship, against whom they held heavy 
accounts.&nbsp; Proofs of the imposture were numerous and indisputable, and
the newspapers declared that Lord X--- would not dare to show his face 
again in New York.&nbsp; Everybody was laughing at the result of the 
affair.</p>
<p>What passed between the father-in-law and the young couple is not known;
but the bride decided to cling to her husband in spite of the 
imposture.&nbsp; Father-in-law was a prudent and a sensitive man, and very 
rich.&nbsp; For his daughter&rsquo;s sake, he accepted the situation.&nbsp;
He paid Lord X---&rsquo;s debts, laughed at the charge of imposture, and 
spoke warmly to every one he met of the great happiness of his &ldquo;dear 
children, Lord and Lady X---.&rdquo;&nbsp; On their return to the city, he 
received them with a grand party, at which all Fifth avenue was present, 
and, though he could not silence the comments of society, he succeeded in 
retaining for his children their places in the world of fashion.&nbsp; He 
was a nabob, and he knew the power of his wealth.&nbsp; He shook his purse 
in the face of society, and commanded it to continue to recognize the 
impostor as Lord X---, and society meekly obeyed him.</p>
<p>Impostures of this kind do not always terminate so fortunately for the 
parties concerned.&nbsp; New York gossip has many a well-authenticated 
story of foreign counts and lords, who have set society in a flutter, and 
have married some foolish, trusting woman, only to be detected when it was 
too late to prevent the trouble.&nbsp; Some of these scoundrels have been 
proved to be married men already, and the consequences of their falsehood 
have, of course, been more serious to the bride.&nbsp; Others again do not 
enter the matrimonial market at all, but use their arts to <!-- page 
319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>secure loans
from their new acquaintances.&nbsp; Not long since a foreigner, calling 
himself a Russian Count, and claiming to be sent here on a mission 
connected with the Russian navy, succeeded in borrowing from some credulous
acquaintances, who were dazzled by his pretended rank, sums ranging from 
$500 to $2000, and amounting in the aggregate to $30,000.&nbsp; When the 
time of payment arrived, the Count had disappeared, and it was ascertained 
that he had escaped to Europe.</p>
<p>Impostors of other kinds are numerous.&nbsp; Men and women are always to
be found in the city, seeking aid for some charitable institution, with 
which they claim to be connected.&nbsp; They carry memorandum books and 
pencils, in the former of which the donor is requested to inscribe his name
and the amount of his gift, in order that it may be acknowledged in due 
form by the proper officers of the institution.&nbsp; Small favors are 
thankfully received, and they depart, assuring you in the most humble and 
sanctimonious manner that &ldquo;the Lord loveth a cheerful 
giver.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you cannot give to-day, they are willing to call 
to-morrow&mdash;next week&mdash;any time that may suit your 
convenience.&nbsp; You cannot insult them by a sharp refusal, or in any 
way, for like Uriah Heep they are always &ldquo;so 
&lsquo;umble.&rdquo;&nbsp; You find it hard to suspect them, but, in truth,
they are the most genuine impostors to be met with in the city.&nbsp; They 
are soliciting money for themselves alone, and have no connection with any 
charitable institution whatever.</p>
<p>One-armed, or one-legged beggars, whose missing member, sound as your 
own, is strapped to their bodies so as to be safely out of sight, women 
wishing to bury their husbands or children, women with hired babies, and 
sundry other objects calculated to excite your pity, meet you at every 
step.&nbsp; They are vagabonds.&nbsp; God knows there is misery enough in 
this great city, but how to tell it from barefaced imposture, is perplexing
and harassing to a charitably disposed person.&nbsp; Nine out of ten street
beggars in New York are unworthy objects, and to give to them is simply to 
encourage vagrancy; and yet to know how to discriminate.&nbsp; That would 
be valuable knowledge to many people in the great city.</p>
<p><!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
320</span>In the fall of 1870, a middle aged woman committed suicide in New
York.&nbsp; For some months she had pursued a singular career in the great 
city, and had literally lived by her wits.&nbsp; While her main object was 
to live comfortably at other people&rsquo;s expense, she also devoted 
herself to an attempt to acquire property without paying for it.&nbsp; She 
arrived in New York in the spring of 1868, and took lodgings at an up-town 
hotel.&nbsp; She brought no baggage, but assured the clerk that her trunks 
had been unjustly detained by a boarding house keeper in Boston with whom 
she had had a difficulty.&nbsp; She succeeded in winning the confidence of 
the clerk, and told him that she had just come into possession of a fortune
of one million dollars, left her by a rich relative, and that she had come 
to New York to purchase a home.&nbsp; She completely deceived the clerk, 
who vouched for her respectability and responsibility, and thus satisfied 
the proprietor of the hotel.&nbsp; She made the acquaintance of nearly all 
the resident guests of the house, and so won their sympathy and confidence 
that she was able to borrow from them considerable sums of money.&nbsp; In 
this way she lived from house to house, making payments on account only 
when obliged to do so, and when she could no longer remain at the hotels, 
she took up her quarters at a private boarding house, passing thence to 
another, and so on.&nbsp; She spent two years in this way, borrowing money 
continually, and paying very little for her board.</p>
<p>In pursuance of her plan to acquire real estate without paying for it, 
she made her appearance in the market as a purchaser.&nbsp; In the summer 
of 1870, she obtained permits of one of the leading real estate agents of 
the city to examine property in his hands for sale, and finally selected a 
house on Madison avenue.&nbsp; The price asked was $100,000, but she coolly
declared her readiness to pay the full amount in cash as soon as the 
necessary deeds could be prepared.&nbsp; The real estate dealer was 
completely deceived by her seeming frankness, and assured her that he would
give his personal attention to the details of the transaction, so that her 
interests would not suffer, and a day was agreed upon for the completion of
the purchase.</p>
<p>The woman then assumed a confidential tone, and told the <!-- page 
321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>gentleman of
her immense fortune.&nbsp; She was absolutely alone in the city, she said, 
without relatives or friends to whom she could apply for advice in the 
management of her property, and she urged him to become her trustee and 
manage the estate for her, offering him a liberal compensation for his 
services.&nbsp; Her object was to make him her trustee, induce him to act 
for her in the purchase of the house, and involve him so far as to secure 
the success of her scheme for getting possession of the property.&nbsp; The
dealer, however, thanked her for her preference, but assured her that it 
was impossible for him to accept her proposition, as he had made it a rule 
never to act as trustee for any one.&nbsp; He did not in the least suspect 
her real design, and but for this previous and fixed determination would 
have acceded to her request.&nbsp; Finding that she could not shake his 
resolution, the lady took her departure, promising to return on the day 
appointed for the payment of the purchase money.</p>
<p>At the time designated, the deeds were ready, and the real estate agent 
and the owner of the Madison avenue mansion awaited the coming of the lady;
but she did not appear, and, after a lapse of several days, the two 
gentlemen concluded they had been victimized, and then the true character 
of the trusteeship he had been asked to assume broke upon the real estate 
agent.&nbsp; The audacity and skill of the scheme fairly staggered him.</p>
<p>After the failure of this scheme, the woman tried several others of a 
similar character, with the same success.&nbsp; In October, 1870, a city 
newspaper, having obtained information respecting her transactions from 
some of her victims, published an account of her career.&nbsp; The next day
she committed suicide, and was found dead in her bed.</p>
<p>Not long since a city lawyer, whom we shall call Smith, and who is much 
given to the procuring of patent divorces for dissatisfied husbands and 
wives, was visited by a richly dressed lady, who informed him that she was 
Mrs. P---, the wife of Mr. P---, of Fifth avenue, and that she wished to 
retain his services in procuring a divorce from her husband, on the ground 
of ill treatment.&nbsp; Mr. P--- was personally a stranger to the <!-- page
322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>lawyer, who 
knew him, however, as a man of great wealth.&nbsp; Visions of a heavy fee 
flashed before him, and he encouraged the lady to make a full statement of 
her grievances, promising to do his best to secure the desired divorce in 
the shortest possible time.&nbsp; He made full notes of her statement, and 
assured her that he felt confident that he would be able to obtain not only
the divorce, but a very large sum as alimony.&nbsp; In reply to her 
question as to his charge for his services, he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I ought to charge you $1000, but out of consideration for 
your sufferings, I will only take a retainer of $100, and when we have 
gained our suit, you will pay me $500 additional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very reasonable,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;and I 
accept the terms.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have nothing with me but a check 
for $200, given me by my husband this morning to use in shopping.&nbsp; I 
shall only need half of it, and if you could get it cashed for 
me&mdash;but, no matter, I&rsquo;ll call to-morrow, and make the 
payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smith, who had seen the millionaire&rsquo;s heavy signature at the 
bottom of the cheek, thought he had better make sure of his retainer, and 
offered to accept the check on the spot.&nbsp; He had just $100 in his 
pocket, and this he gave to the lady who handed him the check, with the 
urgent entreaty that he would not betray her to her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall know nothing of the matter until it is too late for him 
to harm you,&rdquo; said the lawyer, gallantly, as he bowed his fair client
out of the office.</p>
<p>It was after three o&rsquo;clock, and Smith was forced to wait until the
next morning before presenting his check at the bank on which it was 
drawn.&nbsp; Then, to his astonishment, the teller informed him that the 
signature of Mr. P--- was a forgery.&nbsp; Thoroughly incensed, Smith 
hastened to the office of the millionaire, and, laying the check before 
him, informed him that his wife had been guilty of forging his name, and 
that he must make the check good, or the lady would be exposed and 
punished.&nbsp; The millionaire listened blandly, stroking his whiskers 
musingly, and when the lawyer paused, overcome with <!-- page 323--><a 
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>excitement, quietly 
informed him that he was sorry for him, but that he, Mr. P---, had the 
misfortune to be without a wife.&nbsp; He had been a widower for five 
years.</p>
<p>How Smith found his way into the street again, he could never tell, but 
he went back to his work a sadder and a wiser man, musing upon the 
trickiness of mankind in general, and of women in particular.</p>

<h2><!-- page 324--><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
324</span>XIX.&nbsp; STREET MUSICIANS.</h2>
<p>It would be interesting to know the number of street musicians to be 
found in New York.&nbsp; Judging from outward appearances, it must be their
most profitable field, for one cannot walk two blocks in any part of the 
city without hearing one or more musical instruments in full blast.&nbsp; A
few are good and in perfect tone, but the majority emit only the most 
horrible discords.</p>
<p>Prominent among the street musicians are the organ grinders, who in 
former days monopolized the business.&nbsp; They are mostly Italians, 
though one sees among them Germans, Frenchmen, Swiss, and even Englishmen 
and Irishmen.&nbsp; Against these people there seems to be an especial, and
a not very reasonable prejudice.&nbsp; A lady, eminent for her good deeds 
among the poor of the Five Points, once said, &ldquo;There is no reason why
an organ grinder should be regarded as an altogether discreditable member 
of the community; his vocation is better than that of begging, and he 
certainly works hard enough for the pennies thrown to him, lugging his big 
box around the city from morning until night.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this good 
word for the organ grinder it may be added that he is generally an 
inoffensive person, who attends closely to his business during the day, and
rarely ever falls into the hands of the police.&nbsp; Furthermore, however 
much grown people with musical tastes may be annoyed, the organ grinders 
furnish an immense amount of amusement and pleasure to the children; and in
some of the more wretched sections provide all the music that the little 
ones ever hear.</p>
<p>Very few of them own their organs.&nbsp; There are several firms in the 
city who manufacture or import hand organs, and <!-- page 325--><a 
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>from these the 
majority of the grinders rent their instruments.&nbsp; The rent varies from
two to twenty dollars per month, the last sum being paid for the French 
flute organs, which are the best.&nbsp; The owners of the instruments 
generally manage to inspire the grinders with a profound terror of them, so
that few instruments are carried off unlawfully, and, after all, the organ 
grinders are more unfortunate than dishonest.</p>
<p>Organ grinding in New York was once a very profitable business, and even
now pays well in some instances.&nbsp; Some of the grinding fraternity have
made money.&nbsp; One of these was Francisco Ferrari, who came to this city
ten years ago.&nbsp; He invested the money he brought with him in a hand 
organ and a monkey, and in about five years made money enough to return to 
Italy and purchase a small farm.&nbsp; He was not content in his native 
land, however, and soon returned to New York with his family and resumed 
his old trade.&nbsp; He is said to be worth about twenty thousand 
dollars.</p>
<p>At present, in fair weather, a man with a good flute organ can generally
make from two to five dollars a day.&nbsp; Those who have the best and 
sweetest toned instruments seek the better neighborhoods, where they are 
always sure of an audience of children whose parents pay well.&nbsp; Some 
of these musicians earn as much as ten and fifteen dollars in a single 
day.&nbsp; In bad weather, however, they are forced to be idle, as a good 
organ cannot be exposed to the weather at such times without being 
injured.</p>
<p>A monkey is a great advantage to the grinder, as the animal, if clever, 
is sure to draw out a host of pennies from the crowd which never fails to 
gather around it.&nbsp; The monkey is generally the property of the 
grinder.&nbsp; It is his pet, and it is interesting to see the amount of 
affection which exists between the two.&nbsp; If the grinder is a married 
man, or has a daughter or sister, she generally accompanies him in his 
rounds.&nbsp; Sometimes girls and women make regular business engagements 
of this kind with the grinders, and receive for their services in beating 
the tambourine, or soliciting money from the bystanders, a certain fixed 
proportion of the earnings of the day.</p>
<p><!-- page 326--><a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
326</span>If the organ grinder be successful in his business, he has every 
opportunity for saving his money.&nbsp; Apart from the rent of his organ, 
his expenses are slight.&nbsp; Few, however, save very much, as but few are
able to earn the large sums we have mentioned.&nbsp; The grinders pay from 
five to eight dollars per month for their rooms, and they and their 
families live principally upon macaroni.&nbsp; They use but a single room 
for all purposes, and, no matter how many are to be provided with sleeping 
accommodations, manage to get along in some way.&nbsp; As a general rule, 
they are better off here than they were in their own country, for poverty 
has been their lot in both.&nbsp; Their wants are simple, and they can live
comfortably on an amazingly small sum.&nbsp; The better class of Italians 
keep their apartments as neat as possible.&nbsp; Children of a genial 
clime, they are fond of warmth, and the temperature of their rooms stands 
at a stage which would suffocate an American.&nbsp; They are very 
exclusive, and herd by themselves in a section of the Five Points.&nbsp; 
Baxter and Park and the adjoining streets are taken up to a great extent 
with Italians.</p>
<p>This is the life of the fortunate members of the class.&nbsp; There are 
many, however, who are not so lucky.&nbsp; These are the owners or renters 
of the majority of the street organs, the vile, discordant instruments 
which set all of one&rsquo;s nerves a tingling.&nbsp; They earn 
comparatively little, and are not tolerated by the irate householders whose
tastes they offend.&nbsp; The police treat them with but small 
consideration.&nbsp; The poor wretches are nearly always in want, and soon 
full into vagrancy, and some into vice and crime.&nbsp; Some of them are 
worthless vagabonds, and nearly all the Italians accused of crime in the 
city are included in their number.&nbsp; One of these men is to be seen on 
the Bowery at almost any time.&nbsp; He seats himself on the pavement, with
his legs tucked under him, and turns the crank of an instrument which seems
to be a doleful compromise between a music box and an accordion.&nbsp; In 
front of this machine is a tin box for pennies, and by the side of it is a 
card on which is printed an appeal to the charitable.&nbsp; At night a 
flickering tallow dip sheds a dismal glare around.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s 
head is tied up in a piece of white muslin, his eyes are closed, and his 
face and posture are <!-- page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>expressive of the most intense misery.&nbsp; 
He turns the crank slowly, and the organ groans and moans in the most 
ludicrously mournful manner.&nbsp; At one side of the queer instrument sits
a woman with a babe at her breast, on the other side sits a little boy, and
a second boy squats on the ground in front.&nbsp; Not a sound is uttered by
any of the group, who are arranged with genuine skill.&nbsp; Their whole 
attitude is expressive of the most fearful misery.&nbsp; The groans of the 
organ cannot fail to attract attention, and there are few kind-hearted 
persons who can resist the sight.&nbsp; Their pennies and ten-cent stamps 
are showered into the tin box, which is never allowed to contain more than 
two or three pennies.&nbsp; The man is an Italian, and is said by the 
police to be a worthless vagabond.&nbsp; Yet he is one of the most 
successful musicians of his class in the city.</p>
<p>The arrangements of a street organ being entirely automatic, any one who
can turn a crank can manage one of these instruments.&nbsp; Another class 
of street musicians are required to possess a certain amount of musical 
skill in order to be successful.&nbsp; These are the strolling harpers and 
violinists.&nbsp; Like the organ grinders, they are Italians.&nbsp; Very 
few of them earn much money, and the majority live in want and misery.</p>
<p>Some of these strollers are men, or half-grown youths, and are excellent
performers.&nbsp; The best of them frequent Broadway, Wall and Broad 
streets, and the up-town neighborhoods.&nbsp; At night they haunt the 
localities of the hotels.&nbsp; They constitute one of the pleasantest 
features of the street, for their music is good and well worth listening 
to.&nbsp; They generally reap a harvest of pennies and fractional 
currency.&nbsp; They form the aristocratic portion of the street minstrel 
class, and are the envy of their less fortunate rivals.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the strolling harpers and violinists are children; 
generally boys below the age of sixteen.&nbsp; They are chiefly Italians, 
though a few Swiss, French and Germans are to be found among them.&nbsp; 
They are commonly to be found in the streets in pairs; but sometimes three 
work together, and again only one is to be found.&nbsp; There are several 
hundreds of these children on the streets.&nbsp; Dirty, wan, shrunken, <!--
page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
328</span>monkey-faced little creatures they are.&nbsp; Between them and 
other children lies a deep gulf, across which they gaze wistfully at the 
sports and joys that may not be theirs.&nbsp; All day long, and late into 
the night, they must ply their dreary trade.</p>
<p>Although natives of the land of song, they have little or no musical 
talent, as a class, and the majority of them are furnished with harps and 
violins from which not even Orpheus himself could bring harmony.&nbsp; Not 
a few of the little ones endeavor to make up in dancing what they lack in 
musical skill.&nbsp; They work energetically at their instruments, but they
do no more than produce the vilest discord.&nbsp; At the best, their music 
is worthless, and their voices have a cracked, harsh, monotonous sound; but
the sound of them is also very sad, and often brings a penny into the 
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>At all hours of the day, and until late at night you may hear their 
music along the street, and listen to their sad young voices going up to 
the ear that is always open to them.&nbsp; They are half clothed, half fed,
and their filthiness is painful to behold.&nbsp; They sleep in fair weather
under a door-step or in some passage way or cellar, or in a box or hogshead
on the street, and in the winter huddle together in the cold and darkness 
of their sleeping places, for we cannot call them homes, and long for the 
morning to come.&nbsp; The cold weather is very hard upon them, they love 
the warm sunshine, and during the season of ice and snow are in a constant 
state of semi-torpor.&nbsp; You see them on the street, in their thin, 
ragged garments, so much overpowered by the cold that they can scarcely 
strike or utter a note.&nbsp; Sometimes a kind-hearted saloon-keeper will 
permit them to warm themselves at his stove for a moment or two.&nbsp; 
These are the bright periods in their dark lives, for as a general rule 
they are forced to remain on the street from early morning until late at 
night.</p>
<p>A recent writer, well informed on the subject, says: &ldquo;It is a 
cruelty to encourage these children with a gift of money, for instead of 
such gifts inuring to their benefit, they are extracted for the support of 
cruel and selfish parents and taskmasters.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is true, but 
the gift is a benefit to the child, nevertheless.&nbsp; <!-- page 329--><a 
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>These children have 
parents or relatives engaged in the same business, who require them to 
bring in a certain sum of money at the end of the day, and if they do not 
make up the amount they are received with blows and curses, and are refused
the meagre suppers of which they are so much in need, or are turned into 
the streets to pass the night.&nbsp; The poor little wretches come crowding
into the Five Points from nine o&rsquo;clock until midnight, staggering 
under their heavy harps, those who have not made up the required sum 
sobbing bitterly in anticipation of the treatment in store for them.&nbsp; 
Give them a penny or two, should they ask it, reader.&nbsp; You will not 
miss it.&nbsp; It will go to the brutal parent or taskmaster, it is true, 
but it will give the little monkey-faced minstrel a supper, and save him 
from a beating.&nbsp; It is more to them than to you, and it will do you no
harm for the recording angel to write opposite the follies and sins of your
life, that you cast one gleam of sunshine into the heart of one of these 
children.</p>
<p>A number of Italian gentlemen resident in New York have generously 
devoted themselves to the task of bettering the lot of these little ones, 
and many of those who formerly lived on the streets are now in attendance 
upon the Italian schools of the city.&nbsp; Yet great is the suffering 
amongst those who have not been reached by these efforts.&nbsp; Only one or
two years ago there were several wretches living in the city who carried on
a regular business of importing children from Tuscany and Naples, and 
putting them on the streets here as beggars, musicians, and thieves.&nbsp; 
They half starved the little creatures, and forced them to steal as well as
beg, and converted the girls into outcasts at the earliest possible 
age.&nbsp; The newspapers at length obtained information respecting these 
practices, and by exposing them, drew the attention of the civil 
authorities to them.&nbsp; One of the scoundrels, named Antonelli, was 
arrested, tried, and sentenced to the penitentiary, and the infamous 
business was broken up.&nbsp; The police authorities are possessed of 
information which justifies them in asserting that some Italian children 
fare quite as badly at the hands of their own parents.&nbsp; There have 
been several instances where Italian fathers have made a practice of <!-- 
page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>hiring 
out their daughters for purposes of prostitution, while they were yet mere 
children.</p>
<p>As a rule, the future of these little folks is very sad.&nbsp; The 
Italian and the Mission schools in the Five Points and similar sections of 
the city are doing much for them, but the vast majority are growing up in 
ignorance.&nbsp; Without education, with an early and constant familiarity 
with want, misery, brutality and crime, the little minstrels rarely 
&ldquo;come to any good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girls grow up to lives of sin and
shame, and many fortunately die young.&nbsp; The boys too often become 
thieves, vagrants, and assassins.&nbsp; Everybody condemns them.&nbsp; They
are forced onward in their sad career by all the machinery of modern 
civilization, and they are helpless to ward off their ruin.</p>
<p>During one of the heavy snows of a recent winter, a child harper trudged
wearily down the Fifth avenue, on his way to the Five Points, where he was 
to pass the night.&nbsp; It was intensely cold, and the little 
fellow&rsquo;s strength was so exhausted by fatigue and the bleak night 
wind that he staggered under the weight of his harp.&nbsp; At length he sat
down on the steps of a splendid mansion to rest himself.&nbsp; The house 
was brilliantly lighted, and he looked around timidly as he seated himself,
expecting the usual command to move off.&nbsp; No one noticed him, however,
and he leaned wearily against the balustrade, and gazed at the handsome 
windows through which the rich, warm light streamed out into the wintry 
air.&nbsp; As he sat there, strains of exquisite music, and the sounds of 
dancing, floated out into the night.&nbsp; The little fellow clasped his 
hands in ecstasy and listened.&nbsp; He had never heard such melody, and it
made his heart ache to think how poor and mean was his own minstrelsy 
compared with that with which his ears were now ravished.&nbsp; The wind 
blew fierce and keen down the grand street, whirling the snow about in 
blinding clouds, but the boy neither saw nor heard the strife of the 
elements.&nbsp; He heard only the exquisite melody that came floating out 
to him from the warm, luxurious mansion, and which grew sweeter and richer 
every moment.&nbsp; The cold, hard street became more and more indistinct 
to him, and he sat very still with his hands clasped and his eyes 
closed.</p>
<p><!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
331</span>The ball ended towards the small hours of the morning, and the 
clatter of carriages dashing up to the door of the mansion gave the signal 
to the guests that it was time to depart.&nbsp; No one had seen the 
odd-looking bundle that lay on the street steps, half buried in the snow, 
and which might have lain there until the morning had not some one stumbled
over it in descending to the carriages.&nbsp; With a half curse, one of the
men stooped down to examine the strange object, and found that the bundle 
of rags and filth contained the unconscious form of a child.&nbsp; The 
harp, which lay beside him, told his story.&nbsp; He was one of the little 
outcasts of the streets.&nbsp; Scorning to handle such an object, the man 
touched him with his foot to arouse him, thinking he had fallen 
asleep.&nbsp; Alas! it was the eternal sleep.</p>

332</span>XX.&nbsp; THE CENTRAL PARK.</h2>
<p>Though of comparatively recent date, the Central Park, the chief 
pleasure ground of New York, has reached a degree of perfection in the 
beauty and variety of its attractions, that has made it an object of pride 
with the citizens of the metropolis.</p>
<p>For many years previous to its commencement, the want of a park was 
severely felt in New York.&nbsp; There was literally no place on the island
where the people could obtain fresh air and pleasant exercise.&nbsp; Harlem
lane and the Bloomingdale road were dusty and disagreeable, and moreover 
were open only to those who could afford the expense of keeping or hiring a
conveyance.&nbsp; People of moderate means, and the laboring classes were 
obliged to leave the city to obtain such recreation.&nbsp; All classes 
agreed that a park was a necessity, and all were aware that such a place of
resort would have to be constructed by artificial means.</p>
<p>The first step taken in the matter was by Mayor Kingsland, who, on the 
5th of April 1851, submitted a message to the Common Council, setting forth
the necessity of a park, and urging that measures be taken at once for 
securing a suitable site, before the island should be covered with streets 
and buildings.&nbsp; The message was referred to a select committee, who 
reported in favor of purchasing a tract of 150 acres, known as 
Jones&rsquo;s Woods, lying between Sixty-sixth and Seventy-fifth streets, 
and Third avenue and the East River.&nbsp; There was a strong pressure 
brought to bear upon the City Government to secure the purchase of this 
tract, although the citizens as a rule ridiculed the idea of providing a 
park of only 150 acres for a city whose population would soon be 
1,000,000.&nbsp; Yet the Jones&rsquo;s Wood tract came very near being 
decided upon, and the <!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>purchase was only prevented by a quarrel 
between two members of the Legislature from the City of New York, and the 
city was saved from a mistake which would have been fatal to its 
hopes.&nbsp; On the 5th of August, 1851, a committee was appointed by the 
Legislature to examine whether a more suitable location for a park could be
found, and the result of the inquiry was the selection and purchase of the 
site now known as the Central Park, the bill for that purpose passing the 
Legislature on the 23d of July, 1853.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p333.jpg">
<img alt="VIEW FROM THE UPPER TERRACE." src="images/p333.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In November, 1853, Commissioners were appointed to assess the value of 
the land taken for the park, and on the 5th of February, 1856, their report
was confirmed by the City Government.&nbsp; In May, 1856, the Common 
Council appointed the first Board of Commissioners, with power to select 
and carry <!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
334</span>out a definite plan for the construction of the park.&nbsp; This 
Board consisted of the Mayor and Street Commissioner, who were <i>ex 
officio</i> members, Washington Irving, George Bancroft, James E. Cooley, 
Charles F. Briggs, James Phalen, Charles A. Dana, Stewart Brown and 
others.&nbsp; The designs submitted by Messrs. Frederick L. Olmstead and C.
Vaux were accepted, and have since been substantially carried out.&nbsp; 
The surveys had previously been made by a corps of engineers, at the head 
of which was Mr., now General Egbert L. Viele.</p>
<p>The task before the architects and Commissioners was an arduous 
one.&nbsp; With the exception of making a few hollows, and throwing up a 
few rocks and bluffs, nature had done nothing for this part of the 
island.&nbsp; It was bleak, dreary and sickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The southern 
portion was already a part of the straggling suburbs of the city, and a 
suburb more filthy, squalid and disgusting can hardly be imagined.&nbsp; A 
considerable number of its inhabitants were engaged in occupations which 
are nuisances in the eye of the law; and were consequently followed at 
night in wretched hovels, half-hidden among the rocks, where also heaps of 
cinders, brickbats, potsherds, and other rubbish were deposited.&nbsp; The 
grading of streets through and across it had been commenced, and the rude 
embankments and ragged rock-excavations thus created added much to the 
natural irregularities of its surface.&nbsp; Large reaches of stagnant 
water made the aspect yet more repulsive; and so ubiquitous were the rocks 
that it is said, not a square rood could be found throughout which a 
crowbar could be thrust its length into the ground without encountering 
them.&nbsp; To complete the miseries of the scene, the wretched squatters 
had, in the process of time, ruthlessly denuded it of all its vegetation 
except a miserable tangled underbrush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking around now upon the beautiful landscape, with its exquisite 
lawns and shrubbery, its picturesque hills, and romantic walks and drives, 
its sparkling lakes, cascades and fountains, it is hard to realize that so 
much loveliness was preceded by such hideousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p335.jpg">
<img alt="FOOT-BRIDGE IN CENTRAL PARK." src="images/p335.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Central Park, so called because it is situated almost in <!-- page 
336--><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>the centre 
of the island of Manhattan, is a parallelogram in shape, and lies between 
Fifty-ninth street on the south, and One-hundred-and-tenth street on the 
north, the Fifth avenue on the east, and the Eighth avenue on the 
west.&nbsp; It covers an area of 843 acres, and is about two and a half 
miles long, by half a mile wide.&nbsp; There are nine miles of carriage 
drives, four miles of bridle roads, and twenty-five miles of walks within 
its limits.&nbsp; It is the second park in the Union in size; the Fairmount
Park at Philadelphia being the largest.&nbsp; It is larger than any city 
park in Europe, with the exception of the Bois de Boulogne at Paris, the 
Prater at Vienna, and the Phoenix at Dublin.&nbsp; A rocky ridge, which 
traverses the whole island, passes through almost the exact centre of the 
grounds, and has afforded a means of rendering the scenery most beautiful 
and diversified.&nbsp; A part of the grounds forms a miniature Alpine 
region; another part is the perfection of water scenery; and still another 
stretches away in one of the loveliest lawns in the world.&nbsp; The soil 
will nurture almost any kind of tree, shrub, or plant; and more than one 
hundred and sixty thousand trees and shrubs of all kinds have been planted,
and the work is still going on.&nbsp; Any of the principal walks will 
conduct the visitor all over the grounds, and afford him a fine view of the
principal objects of interest.</p>
<p>The park is divided into two main sections, known as the Upper and Lower
Parks, the two being separated by the immense Croton Reservoirs, which 
occupy the central portion of the grounds.&nbsp; Thus far the Lower Park 
has received the greatest amount of ornamentation.&nbsp; It is a miracle of
exquisite landscape gardening.&nbsp; Its principal features are its lawns, 
the Pond, the Lake, the Mall, the Terrace, the Ramble, and the Museum of 
Natural History.&nbsp; The main entrances are on Fifty-ninth street, those 
at the Fifth and Eighth avenues being for vehicles, equestrians, and 
pedestrians, and those at the Sixth and Seventh avenues for pedestrians 
only.&nbsp; All these entrances will ultimately be ornamented with 
magnificent gateways.&nbsp; Paths leading from them converge at the 
handsome Marble Arch at the lower end of the Mall.</p>
<p><!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
337</span>Near the Fifth avenue gate is a fine bronze colossal bust of 
Alexander Von Humboldt, the work of Professor Blaiser of Berlin, which was 
presented to the park by the German citizens of New York, and inaugurated 
on the 14th of September, 1869, the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth 
of the great man.</p>
<p>Near the Eighth avenue gate is a bronze statue of Commerce, the gift of 
Mr. Stephen B. Guion.</p>
<p>At the extreme southern end of the park, and between the Fifth and Sixth
avenue gates, is a small, irregular sheet of water, lying in a deep 
hollow.&nbsp; The surrounding hills have been improved with great taste, 
and the pond and its surroundings constitute one of the prettiest features 
of the park.&nbsp; The water consists mainly of the natural drainage of the
ground.</p>
<p>Along the Fifth avenue side of the park, near Sixty-fourth street, is a 
large and peculiar-looking building, not unlike the cadet barracks at West 
Point.&nbsp; This was formerly used by the State as an arsenal, but was 
purchased by the city, in 1856, for the sum of $275,000.&nbsp; It has been 
recently fitted up as a Museum of Natural History, and the first, second, 
and third floors contain the magnificent collection of the American Museum 
Association.&nbsp; This collection is in charge of Professor Bickmore, and 
includes 12,000 birds, 1000 mammals, 3000 reptiles and fishes, and a large 
number of insects and corals.&nbsp; It is the largest and most perfect 
collection in the country.&nbsp; The famous collection of the Archduke 
Maximilian forms the nucleus of this one.</p>
<p>In the top floor of the Museum building is the Meteorological 
Observatory of the Central Park, under charge of Professor Daniel 
Draper.&nbsp; Here are ingenious and interesting instruments for measuring 
the velocity and direction of the wind, the fall of rain and snow, and for 
ascertaining the variation of the temperature, etc.&nbsp; The establishment
is very complete, and a portion of it is open to visitors.&nbsp; The 
basement floors of the building are occupied by the offices of the Central 
Park authorities, and a police station.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p338.jpg">
<img alt="THE MARBLE ARCH." src="images/p338.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The open space surrounding the Museum edifice is taken up with buildings
and cages containing the living animals, birds, <!-- page 339--><a 
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>and reptiles of the 
collection.&nbsp; They are admirably arranged, and the occupants are all 
fine specimens of their species.&nbsp; These accommodations are only 
temporary, as the Commissioners are now engaged in the construction of a 
Zoological Garden, on Eighth avenue, between Seventy-seventh and 
Eighty-first streets, immediately opposite the park, with which it will be 
connected by means of a tunnel under the Eighth avenue.</p>
<p>Just north of the pond, and on the high ground above it, is a pretty 
gothic structure of stone, known as <i>The Dairy</i>.&nbsp; It is 
contiguous to the South Transverse Road, and supplies may be taken to it 
without using the park thoroughfares.&nbsp; Pure milk and refreshments, 
especially such as are suited to children, may be obtained at a moderate 
cost.</p>
<p>A short distance from the Dairy is the children&rsquo;s summer house, 
near which is a cottage with toilette rooms, closets, etc., for the use of 
ladies and children.&nbsp; Near by are a number of self-acting swings, and 
a little to the north is the Carrousel, a circular building, containing a 
number of hobby-horses, which are made to gallop around in a circle by the 
turning of a crank in the centre of the machine.&nbsp; To the west of this 
building is the base-ball ground, covering some forty or fifty acres.&nbsp;
A commodious brick cottage has been erected here for the accommodation of 
the ball players.</p>
<p>The paths from the Fifty-ninth street gates converge at the Marble Arch,
which lies a little to the northeast of the Dairy.&nbsp; This is one of the
most beautiful and costly structures in the park, and consists entirely of 
marble.&nbsp; Its purpose is to carry the main carriage drive over the 
foot-path without interrupting the level, and at the same time to furnish a
pleasant access from the lower level of the Southwest Park to the 
Mall.&nbsp; A broad double stairway, to the right and left, leads from the 
Mall to the interior of the Arch.&nbsp; On either side runs a marble bench,
on which, in the summer, the visitor may sit and enjoy the delightful 
coolness of the place; and opposite the upper end of the Arch, beyond the 
stairway, is a niche, around which is a marble bench.&nbsp; In the centre 
is a drinking fountain.</p>
<p>The Mall extends from the Marble Arch to the Terrace.&nbsp; It <!-- page
340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>constitutes 
the grand promenade of the park, and near its upper end is the handsome 
music stand, from which concerts are given by the Central Park Band, on 
Saturday afternoons during the mild season.&nbsp; The Mall is about 1200 
feet long by 200 feet wide.&nbsp; In the centre is a promenade, thirty-five
feet wide.&nbsp; The remainder is laid out in lawns, and is shaded by four 
rows of American elms.&nbsp; The Mall terminates on the north in a spacious
square or plaza, which is ornamented with two pretty revolving fountains, 
and a number of bird cages mounted on pedestals.&nbsp; In the spring and 
summer, numerous vases of flowers are placed here.&nbsp; On concert days, 
the upper part of the Mall is covered with rustic seats shaded by canvass 
awnings, where the visitor may sit and listen to the music.&nbsp; At such 
times, a large programme of the performance is posted on a movable frame 
placed opposite the music stand.&nbsp; These concerts are very good, and 
draw large audiences.</p>
<p>To the west of the Mall is a beautiful lawn, called the Green, covering 
fifteen acres, and terminated on the northwest by a hill, on the summit of 
which is placed a gaudy building in which artificial mineral waters are 
sold.</p>
<p>Along the northeastern side of the Mall, and elevated about twenty feet 
above it, is a rustic bower of iron trellis work, over which are trained 
wisterias, honeysuckle, and rose vines.&nbsp; This is the Vine-covered 
Walk, and from it visitors may overlook the Terrace, Lake, Ramble, and 
Mall.</p>
<p>Adjoining it on the east is an open square, in which carriages only are 
allowed.&nbsp; Across this square is the Casino, a handsome brick cottage, 
used as a ladies&rsquo; restaurant.&nbsp; The fare here is good, and the 
prices are moderate.&nbsp; The establishment is conducted by private 
parties under the supervision of the Commissioners.</p>
<p>In the grounds in the rear of the Casino, is a fine group of figures in 
sandstone, called &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne,&rdquo; the work of Robert Thomson,
the self-taught sculptor, and a little to the southeast of this is a bronze
statue of Professor Morse, erected by the Telegraph Operators&rsquo; 
Association, and executed by Byron M. Pickett.</p>

/>
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
342</span>At the northern end of the Mall is the Terrace, and between the 
two is a magnificent screen work of Albert freestone, in which are two 
openings whereby persons can leave their carriages and enter the Mall, or 
from it can cross the drive and reach the stairs leading to the Lower 
Terrace.&nbsp; A flight of massive stairs leads directly from the Mall to 
the arcade or hall under the drive, through which the visitor may pass to 
the Lower Terrace, which is on the same level.&nbsp; This hall is paved, 
and the walls and ceiling are inlaid with beautiful designs in encaustic 
tiles.&nbsp; It is now used as a refreshment room.&nbsp; The Terrace is 
constructed almost entirely of Albert freestone, and is very massive and 
beautiful in design.&nbsp; It is elaborately and exquisitely carved with 
appropriate figures and emblems, some of which are very quaint.&nbsp; Our 
engraving will give the reader a fair idea of its appearance from the 
water.&nbsp; In the summer, the slope adjoining the Terrace is studded with
flowers, which give to the scene a very brilliant effect.</p>
<p>In the centre of the Lower Terrace is a large basin from the midst of 
which rises a fine jet of water.&nbsp; This fountain is to be ornamented 
with magnificent bronze castings, now on their way from Munich, where they 
were made.</p>
<p>The Central Lake washes the northern end of the Lower Terrace, and 
stretches away from it to the east and west.&nbsp; It is without doubt the 
most beautiful feature of the park.&nbsp; It covers between twenty and 
thirty acres, and is as pretty a sheet of water as can be found in the 
country.&nbsp; Upon its upper side are the wooded heights of the Ramble, 
which in some places slope down gently to the water&rsquo;s edge, and in 
others jut out into the lake in bold, rocky headlands.&nbsp; The 
magnificent Terrace, with its fountain and flowers, and carvings, adorns 
the southeastern portion.&nbsp; To the west of the Terrace the lake narrows
very greatly, and is spanned by a light iron structure, called the Bow 
Bridge, from its peculiar shape.&nbsp; It is used for pedestrians 
only.&nbsp; Heavy vases filled with trailing flowers adorn its abutments, 
and from this it is sometimes called the Flower Bridge.&nbsp; The western 
part of the lake is a lovely sheet of water, and comprises more than 
two-thirds of the whole lake.&nbsp; Its northwestern end is <!-- page 
343--><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>spanned by a
handsome stone bridge, which carries the drive across that part of the 
lake, and close by is another, picturesquely constructed of wood, which 
conducts a foot-path across the head of the lake.</p>
<p>At the Terrace there is a boat-house, in which is to be found the 
manager of the fleet of pleasure boats which dot the surface of the 
water.&nbsp; The regular fare around the lake in the omnibus or public 
boats is ten cents.&nbsp; Persons may hire a boat for their private use on 
the payment of a moderate sum.&nbsp; They may either make the circuit of 
the lake in these boats, or may leave them at any of the six pretty 
boat-houses which are arranged at convenient points on the shore.&nbsp; The
popularity of these boats may be judged from the fact that in 1869, 126,000
persons used them.</p>
<p>Whole fleets of snow-white swans are constantly sailing through the 
waters.&nbsp; They are among the finest specimens of their species in 
existence.&nbsp; At the opening of the park twelve of these birds were 
presented to the Commissioners by the city of Hamburg in Germany.&nbsp; 
Nine of these died, and twelve more were presented by the same city.&nbsp; 
Fifty others were given by some gentlemen in London.&nbsp; Of the original 
seventy-four, twenty-eight died, and the remaining forty-six with their 
progeny form one of the pleasantest attractions of the lake.&nbsp; A number
of white ducks have been added to the collection.&nbsp; All the birds are 
quite tame, and come readily to the call.</p>
<p>On a bright moonlight night in the summer, the scene to be witnessed on 
the lake is brilliant.&nbsp; The clear waters gleam like polished steel in 
the moonlight, and are dotted in every direction with pleasure boats, each 
of which carries a red or blue light; the swans sail majestically up and 
down in groups; on every side is heard the dash of oars, and the sound of 
laughter and happy voices; and the air is heavily laden with the perfume of
the flowers along the shore.&nbsp; No sight or sound of the great city is 
at hand to disturb you, and you may lie back in your boat with half shut 
eyes, and think yourself in fairyland.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p344.jpg">
<img alt="THE TERRACE, AS SEEN FROM THE LAKE." src="images/p344.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In the winter the scene is different.&nbsp; Huge houses are erected on 
the shores of all the sheets of water in the park, and are <!-- page 
344--><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>provided 
with sitting-rooms, fires, restaurants, and counters at which skates may be
hired for a trifling sum.&nbsp; The water is lowered to a depth sufficient 
to prevent the occurrence of any serious accident in case the ice should 
break, and the ice itself is carefully watched, and is scraped smooth after
the sports of the day are over.&nbsp; Rotten ice is quickly detected and 
marked with a sign bearing the word &ldquo;Danger.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the 
ice is in suitable condition, a red ball is hoisted on the Arsenal, and 
little white flags, on which is printed a similar ball, are affixed to the 
cars running between the park and the lower part of the city.&nbsp; Then 
the pleasure seekers come out in throngs, and soon the ice is 
crowded.&nbsp; At night the lakes are lighted by numerous gas jets with 
powerful reflectors, placed along the shore.&nbsp; The Central Lake at such
times is a sight worth seeing.&nbsp; The Commissioners prepare a code of 
liberal rules for the government of skaters, and post them at conspicuous 
points.&nbsp; All persons going on the ice are required to comply with 
them, on pain of exclusion from the sport.</p>
<p>To the east of the Central Lake, and along the Fifth avenue side, is a 
small pond, on the verge of which a large Conservatory, which is to be one 
of the principal ornaments of the park, is now in course of erection.</p>
<p>On the heights to the north of the lake lies the Ramble, which covers an
area of about thirty-six acres, and is a labyrinth of wooded walks, 
abounding in the prettiest rustic nooks, with tiny bridges over little 
brooks, wild flowers and vines, and bits of lawn, and rock work, all so 
naturally and simply arranged that it is hard to believe it is not the work
of nature.&nbsp; It is one of the most beautiful portions of the park.</p>
<p>At the northern end of the Ramble rises a fine gothic stone tower, which
forms a prominent feature in almost any view of the park.&nbsp; This is the
Belvedere, and is intended to serve as an observatory from which the entire
park may be seen at a glance.&nbsp; The rock upon which it stands is the 
highest point in the park.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p346.jpg">
<img alt="VIEW ON THE CENTRAL LAKE." src="images/p346.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At the foot of this tower are the Croton Reservoirs.&nbsp; There are two
of them.&nbsp; The old or lower one is a parallelogram in form, covering an
area of thirty-one acres, and capable <!-- page 347--><a 
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>of holding 
150,000,000 gallons of water.&nbsp; The new reservoir lies to the north of 
the old, and is separated from it by a transverse road.&nbsp; It is a 
massive structure of granite, irregular in form, and extends almost 
entirely across the park.&nbsp; It covers an area of 106 acres, and will 
hold 1,000,000,000 gallons of water.&nbsp; Thus the two reservoirs take 136
acres from the park.&nbsp; The landscape gardeners have so arranged them 
that they constitute a very attractive feature of the landscape.</p>
<p>North of the new reservoir is the Upper Park.&nbsp; This has been less 
improved than the Lower Park, but is naturally very beautiful.&nbsp; A 
large part of it is taken up with the great ravine formerly known as 
McGowan&rsquo;s Pass.&nbsp; It was through this wild glen that the beaten 
and disheartened fragments of the American army escaped from the city of 
New York after their disastrous rout at the battle of Long Island.&nbsp; 
Close by they were rallied in time to make a stand at Harlem Plains.&nbsp; 
On the hills in the extreme northern part of the park are still to be seen 
the remains of a series of earthworks, which have been carefully turfed 
over, and on one of these heights, known as The Bluff, is an old stone 
structure said to have been used as a block-house or magazine during the 
war of 1812-15.&nbsp; A small part of the &ldquo;old Boston Road&rdquo; is 
still to be seen in this portion of the park, and in the distance a view is
to be obtained of the High Bridge, the Heights of Westchester county, and 
the Palisades, on the New Jersey shore of the Hudson, while Washington 
Heights rise boldly to the northward.&nbsp; To the eastward one may see the
white sails of the vessels in Long Island Sound, and get a faint glimpse of
the town of Flushing, on Long Island, and New Rochelle, on the mainland, 
while nearer are Hell Gate, the picturesque East and Harlem rivers, with 
their islands and public buildings, and the lovely little village of 
Astoria.</p>
<p>The park occupies the centre of the island, from north to south, for a 
distance of two miles and a half.&nbsp; The cross streets do not extend 
through it, and all vehicles of a business nature are excluded from the 
pleasure drives.&nbsp; It was foreseen from the first that it would be 
necessary to provide means of <!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 348</span>communication between the eastern and western 
sides of the island, without compelling wagons and trucks to pass around 
the upper or lower ends of the enclosure.&nbsp; At the same time it was 
felt to be desirable to make these roads as private as possible, so that 
the beauty of the park should not be marred by them, or by the long trains 
of wagons, carts, and such other vehicles as would pass over them.&nbsp; 
The genius of the constructing engineers soon settled this 
difficulty.&nbsp; A system of transverse roads was adopted and carried 
out.&nbsp; There are four of them, and they cross the park at Sixty-fifth, 
Seventy-ninth, Eighty-fifth, and Ninety-seventh streets.&nbsp; They are 
sunken considerably below the general level of the park, and are securely 
walled in with masonry.&nbsp; Vines, trees, and shrubbery are planted and 
carefully trained along the edges of these walls, which conceal the roads 
from view.&nbsp; The visitors, by means of archways or bridges, pass over 
these roads, catching but a momentary glimpse of them in some places, and 
in utter ignorance of them in others.</p>
<p>Near the northeastern end of the park is an elevation known as Mount St.
Vincent.&nbsp; It is crowned with a large rambling structure principally of
wood, to which is attached a fine brick chapel.&nbsp; The building was 
originally used as a Roman Catholic Seminary for young men.&nbsp; It is now
a restaurant, kept by private parties under the control of the 
Commissioners.&nbsp; The chapel is used as a gallery of sculpture, and 
contains the models of the works of the sculptor Thomas Crawford.&nbsp; 
They were presented to the city by his widow in 1860.</p>
<p>Just below this hill is the North Lake, into which flows a stream noted 
for its beauty.</p>
<p>At the Fifth and Eighth Avenue gates are the stations of the Park 
Omnibuses.&nbsp; These are controlled by the Commissioners, and transport 
passengers through the entire park for the sum of twenty-five cents.&nbsp; 
They are open, and afford every facility for seeing the beauties of the 
place.</p>
<p>The original cost of the land included within the park was $5,028,884, 
and up to the close of the year 1869, there had been expended upon it an 
additional sum of $5,775,387; making the total cost of the park, up to 
January 1st, 1870, <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>$10,804,271.&nbsp; Since that time it has cost
about $1,000,000 additional.</p>
<p>The park is controlled by the Commissioners of the Department of Public 
Parks.&nbsp; The principal executive officer is the President.&nbsp; The 
discipline prescribed for the employ&eacute;s is very rigid.&nbsp; A force 
of special policemen, who may be recognized by their gray uniforms, has 
been placed on duty in the park, with the same powers and duties as the 
Metropolitan Police.&nbsp; One of these is always on duty at each gateway, 
to direct visitors and furnish information, as well as to prevent vehicles 
from entering the grounds at too rapid a rate.&nbsp; Others of the force 
are scattered through the grounds at such convenient distances that one of 
them is always within call.&nbsp; None of the employ&eacute;s are allowed 
to ask or to receive pay for their services.&nbsp; Their wages are 
liberal.&nbsp; When an article is found by any of the employ&eacute;s of 
the park, it is his duty to carry it to the property clerk at the Arsenal, 
where it can be identified and recovered by the rightful owner.</p>
<p>Improper conduct of all kinds is forbidden, and promptly checked.&nbsp; 
Visitors are requested not to walk on the grass, except in those places 
where the word &ldquo;Common&rdquo; is posted; not to pick flowers, leaves,
or shrubs, or in any way deface the foliage; not to throw stones or other 
missiles, not to scratch or deface the masonry or carving; and not to harm 
or feed the birds.</p>
<p>No one is allowed to offer anything for sale within the limits of the 
enclosure, without a special licence from the Commissioners.&nbsp; There 
are several hotels, or restaurants, in the grounds.&nbsp; These are 
conducted in first-class style by persons of responsibility and 
character.&nbsp; Private closets for men, which may be distinguished by the
sign, &ldquo;For Gentlemen only,&rdquo; are located at convenient points 
throughout the park, and cottages for ladies and children are as 
numerous.&nbsp; These latter are each in charge of a female attendant, 
whose duty it is to wait upon visitors, and to care for them, in case of 
sudden illness, until medical aid can be procured.</p>
<p>The establishment of the park has been a great blessing to <!-- page 
350--><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>all classes,
but especially to the poor.&nbsp; It places within reach of the latter a 
great pleasure ground, where they may come and enjoy their holidays, and 
obtain the fresh air and bodily and mental enjoyment of which they are 
deprived in their quarters of the city.&nbsp; In mild weather they come 
here in throngs, with their families, and on Sundays the park is crowded 
with thousands who formerly passed the day in drunkenness or vice.&nbsp; 
The Commissioners have no trouble in enforcing their rules.&nbsp; All 
classes are proud of the park, and all observe the strictest decorum 
here.&nbsp; No crime or act of lawlessness has ever been committed within 
the limits of the Central Park since it was thrown open to the 
public.&nbsp; The popularity of the place is attested by the annual number 
of visitors.&nbsp; During the year 1870, 3,494,877 pedestrians, 75,511 
equestrians, 1,616,935 vehicles, and 234 velocipedes, passed within the 
park gates.&nbsp; The total number of persons that entered the park during 
that year, including drivers and the occupants of carriages, was 
8,421,427.</p>

351</span>XXI.&nbsp; THE DETECTIVES.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE REGULAR FORCE.</h3>
<p>The Detective Corps of New York consists of twenty-five men, under the 
command of a Captain, or Chief.&nbsp; Though they really constitute a part 
of the Municipal Police Force, and are subject to the control of the 
Commissioners and higher officers of that body, the detectives have a 
practically distinct organization.&nbsp; The members of this corps are men 
of experience, intelligence, and energy.&nbsp; These qualities are 
indispensable to success in their profession.&nbsp; It requires an unusual 
amount of intelligence to make a good Detective.&nbsp; The man must be 
honest, determined, brave, and complete master over every feeling of his 
nature.&nbsp; He must also be capable of great endurance, of great 
fertility of resource, and possessed of no little ingenuity.&nbsp; He has 
to adopt all kinds of disguises, incur great personal risks, and is often 
subjected to temptations which only an honest man can resist.&nbsp; It is 
said that the Detective&rsquo;s familiarity with crime is in itself a great
temptation, and often leads him from the path of right.&nbsp; However this 
may be, it is certain that a member of the New York force committing an act
savoring of dishonesty is punished by immediate expulsion from his 
post.</p>
<p>The Detectives have a special department assigned them at the Police 
Head-quarters in Mulberry street.&nbsp; There they may be found when not on
duty, and the Chief, when not in his office, is always represented by some 
member of the corps.&nbsp; <!-- page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 352</span>They are kept quite busy.&nbsp; The strangers 
who visit the city throw an immense amount of work upon the 
Detectives.&nbsp; These people often get drunk over night, and frequent 
houses of bad repute, where they are robbed.&nbsp; They naturally invoke 
the aid of the police in seeking to recover their property.&nbsp; 
Frequently, by making a plain statement of their cases, they recover their 
money or valuables, through the assistance of the Detectives.&nbsp; 
Sometimes the stolen property cannot be regained at all.&nbsp; These 
people, as a rule, refuse to prosecute the thieves, and declare their 
determination to submit to the loss rather than endure the publicity which 
would attend a prosecution.&nbsp; Thus the Detectives are forced to 
compound felonies.&nbsp; The injured party refuses to prosecute, and the 
Detective knows that to make an arrest in the case would simply be to take 
trouble for nothing.&nbsp; Consequently, if the plunder is returned, the 
thief is allowed to escape without punishment.</p>
<p>None but those whose duty it is to search out and punish crime, can tell
how much the administration of justice is embarrassed, how much the 
officers of the law are hampered, and how greatly their labors are 
increased by the refusal of respectable persons to prosecute 
criminals.&nbsp; These refusals are not confined to those who seek to avoid
such an exposure as is mentioned above.&nbsp; Merchants and bankers who 
have been robbed by thieves, seem to care for nothing but the recovery of 
their money or property.&nbsp; They will even sacrifice a portion of this 
to regain the remainder.&nbsp; The Detective may fairly work up his case, 
and fasten the crime upon the perpetrator, but he is not sure of meeting 
with the cooperation upon the part of the injured person that he has a 
right to demand.&nbsp; The thief seeing that an arrest is inevitable, may 
offer to return a part or the whole of the property on condition of his 
being allowed to escape.&nbsp; In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the 
proposal is accepted.&nbsp; The merchant recovers his property, and 
immediately exerts himself to secure the escape of the thief.&nbsp; He 
refuses to prosecute the wretch, or if the prosecution is carried on in 
spite of him, his evidence amounts to nothing.&nbsp; He has protected his 
own interests, and he cares nothing for <!-- page 353--><a 
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>society or 
justice.&nbsp; He throws his whole influence against both, and aids the 
thief, in going free, to commit the same crime in another quarter.&nbsp; 
The Detectives complain, and with justice, that it is of no use for them to
arrest a burglar where the stolen property can be recovered.&nbsp; If 
persons who have been wronged in this way would refuse all proposals for a 
compromise, and would endeavor to secure the punishment of the offender, 
the criminal class would be wonderfully thinned out, and the Detectives 
would not, as now, be obliged to arrest the same person over and over 
again, only to see him go free every time.</p>
<p>In June, 1870, a gentleman, passing through Bleecker street, on his way 
home, at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, was knocked down and robbed of 
his watch and money.&nbsp; He was struck with such violence by the 
highwayman that his jaw was permanently injured.&nbsp; He was very eloquent
in his complaints of the inefficiency of a police system which left one of 
the principal streets of the city so unguarded, and was loud in his demands
for the punishment of his assailant, and the recovery of the property 
stolen from him.&nbsp; The best Detectives in the force were put in charge 
of the case, and the highwayman was tracked, discovered and arrested.&nbsp;
The friends of the culprit at once returned the stolen property to its 
owner, and promised to reward him liberally if he would not press the 
prosecution of their comrade, who was one of the leading members of a 
notorious and dangerous gang of ruffians from whose depredations the city 
had been suffering for some time.&nbsp; The offer was accepted, and the 
gentleman flatly refused to prosecute, and when compelled by the 
authorities to state under oath, whether the prisoner was the man who had 
robbed him, became so doubtful and hesitating that his identification was 
worth nothing.&nbsp; This, too, in the face of his previous assertion that 
he could readily identify the criminal.&nbsp; In spite of his misconduct, 
however, there was evidence enough submitted to secure the conviction of 
the prisoner, who was sentenced to an imprisonment of ten years.</p>
<p>The Detectives are in constant telegraphic communication with other 
cities, and intelligence of crimes committed is being <!-- page 354--><a 
name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>constantly received 
and transmitted.&nbsp; Criminals arrested for serious offences are 
photographed, and their pictures placed in the collection known as the 
&ldquo;Rogues&rsquo; Gallery.&rdquo;&nbsp; These likenesses are shown to 
strangers only under certain restrictions, but they aid the force not a 
little in their efforts to discover criminals.&nbsp; The amount of crime 
annually brought to light by the Detectives is startling, but it does not 
exhibit all the evil doings of the great city.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Police 
Commissioners of New York,&rdquo; says Mr. Edward Crapsey, &ldquo;have 
never had the courage to inform the public of the number of burglaries and 
robberies annually committed in the metropolis; but enough is known in a 
general way for us to be certain that there are hundreds of these crimes 
committed of which the public is not told.&nbsp; The rule is to keep secret
all such affairs when an arrest does not follow the offence, and hardly any
police official will venture to claim that the arrest occurs in more than a
moiety of the cases.&nbsp; There are hundreds of such crimes every year 
where the criminal is not detected, and hundreds of thousands of dollars 
worth of property stolen of which the police never find a trace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The individuality of crime is remarkable.&nbsp; Each burglar has a 
distinct method of conducting his operations, and the experienced Detective
can recognize these marks or characteristics as he would the features of 
the offender.&nbsp; Thanks to this experience, which comes only with long 
and patient study, he is rarely at a loss to name the perpetrator of a 
crime if that person be a &ldquo;professional.&rdquo;&nbsp; Appearances 
which have no significance for the mere outsider are pregnant with meaning 
to him.&nbsp; He can determine with absolute certainty whether the mischief
has been done by skilled or unskilled hands, and he can gather up and link 
together evidences which entirely escape the unpractised eye.&nbsp; He 
rejects nothing as unimportant until he has tested it, and is able to 
conduct his search in a systematic manner, which in the majority of cases 
is crowned with success.</p>
<p>A few years ago a man came into one of the police stations of the city, 
and complained that his house had been robbed.&nbsp; He had pursued the 
thief without success, but the latter had dropped a chisel, and had torn up
and thrown away a piece of <!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 355</span>paper in his flight.&nbsp; The captain 
commanding the station and an experienced Detective were present when the 
complaint was made.&nbsp; They carefully examined the owner of the house as
to the mode by which the entrance had been effected, the marks left by the 
tools, the kind of property taken, and the action and bearing of the thief 
while running away.&nbsp; When these facts were laid before them, the two 
officers, without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, concluded that the robbery 
had been committed by a certain gang of thieves well known to them.&nbsp; 
This settled, it became necessary to identify the individual or individuals
belonging to this gang, by whom the robbery had been committed.&nbsp; The 
chisel was examined, but it could give no clue.&nbsp; The house-owner had 
fortunately secured the bits of paper which the thief had thrown 
away.&nbsp; The officers spread a layer of mucilage over a sheet of paper, 
and on this fitted the scraps which were given them.&nbsp; This at once 
disclosed the name of the robber, who was well known to the police as a 
member of the gang to whom the officers attributed the robbery.&nbsp; Their
suspicions were at once confirmed, and the next step was to make the 
arrest.&nbsp; The Detective said that the thief would certainly be at one 
of three places, which he named.&nbsp; Three policemen were accordingly 
sent after him, one to each of the places named, and in an hour or two the 
culprit was safely lodged in the station-house.</p>
<p>It would require a volume to relate the incidents connected with the 
exploits of the Detective Corps of New York.&nbsp; Sometimes the search for
a criminal is swift and short, and the guilty parties are utterly 
confounded by the suddenness of their detection and apprehension.&nbsp; 
Sometimes the search is long and toilsome, involving the greatest personal 
danger, and abounding in romance and adventure.&nbsp; Some of the best 
established incidents of this kind would be regarded simply as Munchausen 
stories, were they related without the authority upon which they 
rest.&nbsp; Such adventures are well known to the reading public, and I 
pass them by here.</p>
<p>But the Detectives are not always successful in their efforts.&nbsp; If 
they are ingenious and full of resource, the criminals they <!-- page 
356--><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>seek are 
equally so, and they find their best efforts foiled and brought to naught 
by the skill of this class in &ldquo;covering up their tracks.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To my mind the most interesting cases are not those in which the 
Detective&rsquo;s labors have been crowned with success, but those in which
he has been baffled and perplexed at every step, and which to-day remain as
deeply shrouded in mystery as at the time of their occurrence.</p>
<p>Inspector James Leonard, in the spring of 1869, related the following 
case to Mr. Edward Crapsey, in whose words it is presented here:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One spring morning, during the first year of the war, a barrel of
pitch was found to have disappeared from a Jersey City pier, and the porter
in charge, when reporting the fact to his employers, took occasion to speak
of the river-thieves in no very complimentary terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the same day, Ada Ricard, a woman of nomadic habits and 
dubious status, but of marvellous beauty, suddenly left her hotel in New 
York, without taking the trouble to announce her departure or state her 
destination.&nbsp; The clerks of the house only remarked that some women 
had queer ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days after these simultaneous events, the same porter who 
had mourned the lost pitch, happening to look down from the end of his pier
when the tide was out, saw a small and shapely human foot protruding above 
the waters of the North River.&nbsp; It was a singular circumstance, for 
the bodies of the drowned never float in such fashion; but the porter, not 
stopping to speculate upon it, procured the necessary assistance, and 
proceeded to land the body.&nbsp; It came up unusually heavy, and when at 
last brought to the surface, was found to be made fast by a rope around the
waist to the missing barrel of pitch.&nbsp; There was a gag securely 
fastened in the mouth, and these two circumstances were positive evidence 
that murder had been done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the body was landed upon the pier, it was found to be in a 
tolerable state of preservation, although there were conclusive signs that 
it had been in the water for some time.&nbsp; It was the body of a female, 
entirely nude, with the exception of <!-- page 357--><a 
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>an embroidered linen 
chemise and one lisle-thread stocking, two sizes larger than the foot, but 
exactly fitting the full-rounded limb.&nbsp; The face and contour of the 
form were, therefore, fully exposed to examination, and proved to be those 
of a woman who must have been very handsome.&nbsp; There was the cicatrice 
of an old wound on a lower limb, but otherwise there was no spot or blemish
upon the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In due time the body was buried; but the head was removed, and 
preserved in the office of the city physician, with the hope that it might 
be the means of establishing the identity of the dead, and leading to the 
detection of the murderer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police on both sides of the river were intensely interested 
in the case; but they found themselves impotent before that head of a 
woman, who seemed to have never been seen upon earth in life.&nbsp; They 
could do nothing, therefore, but wait patiently for whatever developments 
time might bring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chance finally led to the desired identification.&nbsp; A 
gentleman who had known her intimately for two years, happening to see the 
head, at once declared it to be that of Ada Ricard.&nbsp; The Detectives 
eagerly clutched at this thread, and were soon in possession of the 
coincidence in time of her disappearance and that of the barrel of pitch to
which the body was lashed.&nbsp; They further found that, since that time, 
she had not been seen in the city, nor could any trace of her be discovered
in other sections of the country, through correspondence with the police 
authorities of distant cities.&nbsp; They had thus a woman lost and a body 
found, and the case was considered to be in a most promising condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next step was to establish the identity by the testimony of 
those who had known the missing woman most intimately.&nbsp; The 
Detectives, therefore, instituted a search, which was finally successful, 
for Charles Ricard, her putative husband.&nbsp; He had not lived with her 
for some time, and had not even seen or heard of her for months; but his 
recollection was perfect, and he gave a very minute statement of her 
distinguishing marks.&nbsp; He remembered that she had persisted in wearing
a pair of very heavy earrings, until their weight had slit one of her ears 
<!-- page 358--><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
358</span>entirely, and the other nearly so, and that, as a consequence, 
both ears had been pierced a second time, and unusually high up.&nbsp; He 
regretted that her splendid array of teeth had been marred by the loss of 
one upon the left side of the mouth, and told how a wound had been 
received, whose cicatrice appeared upon one of her limbs, stating exactly 
its location.&nbsp; He dwelt with some pride upon the fact that she had 
been forced, by the unusual development, to wear stockings too large for 
her feet, and gave a general description of hair, cast of face, height, and
weight that was valuable, because minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he gave this statement he was not aware of the death of his 
wife, or of the finding of her body, and without being informed of either 
fact he was taken to Jersey City, and suddenly confronted with the 
head.&nbsp; The instant he saw it he sank into a chair in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His statement having been compared with the head and the record 
of the body, the similitude was found to be exact, except as to the 
teeth.&nbsp; The head had one tooth missing on each side of the mouth, and 
this fact having been called to his attention, Ricard insisted that she had
lost but one when he last saw her, but it was highly probable the other had
been forced out in the struggle which robbed her of her life, and the 
physician, for the first time making a minute examination, found that the 
tooth upon the right side had been forced from its place, but was still 
adhering to the gum.&nbsp; He easily pushed it back to its proper position,
and there was the head without a discrepancy between it and the description
of Ada Ricard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Detectives found other witnesses, and among them the 
hair-dresser who had acted in that capacity for Ada Ricard during many 
months, who, in common with all the others, fully confirmed the evidence of
Charles Ricard.&nbsp; The identity of the murdered woman was therefore 
established beyond question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally the next step was to solve the mystery of her 
death.&nbsp; The Detectives went to work with unusual caution, but 
persisted in the task they had assigned themselves, and were slowly 
gathering the shreds of her life, to weave from them a thread that would 
lead to the author of her tragical death, when <!-- page 359--><a 
name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>they were suddenly 
&lsquo;floored,&rsquo; to use their own energetic expression.&nbsp; Ada 
Ricard herself appeared at a down-town New York hotel, in perfect health 
and unscathed in person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The explanation was simple.&nbsp; The whim had suddenly seized 
her to go to New Orleans; and she had gone without leave-taking or 
warning.&nbsp; It was no unusual incident in her wandering life, and her 
speedy return was due only to the fact that she found the Southern city 
only a military camp under the iron rule of General Butler, and therefore 
an unprofitable field for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghastly head became more of a mystery than before.&nbsp; The 
baffled Detectives could again only look at it helplessly, and send 
descriptions of it over the country.&nbsp; At last it was seen by a woman 
named Callahan, living in Boston, who was in search of a daughter who had 
gone astray.&nbsp; She instantly pronounced it to be that of her child, and
she was corroborated by all the members of her family and several of her 
neighbors.&nbsp; The identification was no less specific than before, and 
the perplexed authorities, glad at last to know something certainly, gave 
Mrs. Callahan an order for the body.&nbsp; Before, however, she had 
completed her arrangements for its transfer to Boston, a message reached 
her from the daughter, who was lying sick in Bellevue Hospital, and so the 
head once more became a mystery.&nbsp; And such it has always 
remained.&nbsp; The body told that a female who had been delicately reared,
who had fared sumptuously, and had been arrayed in costly fabrics, had been
foully done to death, just as she was stepping into the dawn of 
womanhood&mdash;and that is all that is known.&nbsp; Her name, her station,
her history, her virtues, or it may be, her frailties, all went down with 
her life, and were irrevocably lost.&nbsp; There is every probability that 
her case will always be classed as unfinished business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Friday, July 20th, 1870, Mr. Benjamin Nathan, a wealthy Jewish 
resident of New York, was foully and mysteriously murdered in his own 
dwelling by an unknown assassin.&nbsp; All the circumstances of the case 
were so mysterious, so horribly dramatic, that the public interest was 
wrought up to the highest pitch.</p>
<p><!-- page 360--><a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
360</span>Mr. Nathan was a millionaire, a banker and citizen of 
irreproachable character, well known for his benevolence, and highly 
esteemed for his personal qualities.&nbsp; His residence stood on the south
side of Twenty-third street, one door west of Fifth Avenue, and immediately
opposite the Fifth Avenue Hotel, in one of the most desirable and 
fashionable neighborhoods of the city.&nbsp; The mansion itself was 
palatial, and its owner had not only surrounded himself with every luxury, 
but had taken every precaution to exclude housebreakers and thieves.&nbsp; 
But a short time before his death, he remarked to a friend that he believed
that his house was as secure as a dwelling could be made.</p>
<p>On the night of the 28th of July, Mr. Nathan slept at his residence, his
family, with the exception of two of his sons, being then at their 
country-seat in New Jersey, where they were passing the summer.&nbsp; One 
of these sons accompanied his father to his sleeping room towards eleven 
o&rsquo;clock, but the other, coming in later, and finding his father 
asleep, passed to his chamber without saying &ldquo;good-night,&rdquo; as 
was his custom.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 29th, at six o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Washington Nathan 
descended from his chamber to call his father to a devotional duty of the 
day.&nbsp; Entering the chamber of the latter, a most appalling spectacle 
met his view.&nbsp; His father was lying on the floor in a pool of his own 
blood, dead, with five ghastly wounds upon his head.&nbsp; The young man at
once summoned his brother Frederick, and the two together rushed to the 
street door and gave the alarm.&nbsp; The police were soon on the spot, 
and, taking possession of the house, they prepared to investigate the 
horrid affair.&nbsp; The newspapers spread the intelligence over the city, 
and the murder created the profoundest interest and uneasiness on the part 
of the citizens.&nbsp; All classes felt an interest in it, for it had been 
committed within the sacred precincts of the dead man&rsquo;s home, where 
he believed himself to be safe.&nbsp; If a murderer could reach him there, 
men asked, who could tell who would not be the next victim.&nbsp; This 
feeling of insecurity was widespread, and the whole community demanded of 
the police extraordinary efforts in tracking and securing the assassin.</p>
<p><!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
361</span>The Superintendent of Police at that time was Captain John 
Jourdan, who was acknowledged to be the most accomplished detective on the 
Continent, and his principal assistant was Captain James Kelso (the present
Superintendent), who was regarded as next to Jourdan in ability.&nbsp; 
These two officers at once repaired to the Nathan mansion, and took 
personal charge of the case.</p>
<p>At the first glance Jourdan pronounced the murder to be the work of a 
thief.&nbsp; The house was carefully searched.&nbsp; The room bore 
evidences of a struggle between the dead man and his assassin, and three 
diamond studs, a sum of money, a Perregaux watch, No. 5657, and the key of 
a small safe, had been stolen from the clothing of the dead man which had 
been hung on a chair placed at some distance from the bed.&nbsp; The safe 
stood in the library beside the door opening into the bed room.&nbsp; 
Jourdan&rsquo;s theory was that the thief, having stolen the watch and 
other articles from the clothing, had gone to the safe to open it, and had 
aroused Mr. Nathan by the noise he made in opening it.&nbsp; Alarmed by 
this noise, Mr. Nathan had sprung from his bed, and at the same moment the 
thief had raised himself up from his kneeling posture, with his face toward
Mr. Nathan, and lighted up by a small gas jet which was burning in the 
chamber.&nbsp; The two men had met in the doorway between the rooms, and 
the thief, seeing himself identified, had struck Mr. Nathan a blow with a 
short iron bar curved at the ends, and known as a ship carpenter&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;dog.&rdquo;&nbsp; A struggle ensued, which resulted in the murder, 
the assassin striking his victim on the head nine times with terrible 
force.&nbsp; Then, rifling the safe of its valuable contents, he had gone 
stealthily down the stairs, had unfastened the front door, which had been 
carefully secured at half an hour after midnight, and, laying the 
&ldquo;dog&rdquo; down on the hall floor, had passed out into the 
street.&nbsp; His object in carrying the &ldquo;dog&rdquo; to the place 
where it was found by the police had been to be prepared to make sure of 
his escape by striking down any one whom he might chance to meet in the 
hall.&nbsp; Once in the street, the assassin had disappeared in safety.</p>
<p>Both Jourdan and Kelso were agreed that this theory of the <!-- page 
362--><a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>commission 
of the crime was correct, and this led to the inevitable conclusion that 
the murder was the work of an &ldquo;outsider,&rdquo; that is, of some one 
not properly belonging to the criminal class.&nbsp; The weapon with which 
the murder had been committed was one which the Detectives had never before
encountered in the annals of crime, and its appearance indicated long use 
in its legitimate sphere.&nbsp; No burglar or professional thief would have
used it, and none of the inmates of the house recognized it as belonging to
the mansion.&nbsp; Again, the professional thief would have despatched his 
victim with more speed and less brutality.&nbsp; There was not the 
slightest sign of the thief having forced an entrance into the mansion, and
the most rigid search failed to reveal the mark of a burglar&rsquo;s tool 
on any of the doors or windows.&nbsp; This fact warranted the conclusion 
that the murderer had secreted himself in the house during the day.&nbsp; 
From the first Jourdan was convinced that the assassin was one of a class 
who pursue an honest trade during the day, and seek to fill their pockets 
more rapidly by committing robberies at night.&nbsp; From this conviction 
he never wavered.</p>
<p>As he stood by the side of the murdered man, Jourdan recognized the 
difficulty of the task of finding the assassin.&nbsp; The &ldquo;dog&rdquo;
bewildered him.&nbsp; Had the weapon been any kind of a burglar&rsquo;s 
tool, or anything that any description of thief had ever been known to use,
he would have been able to trace it to some one in the city; but the facts 
of the case plainly indicated that the assassin was an 
&ldquo;outsider,&rdquo; and even Jourdan and Kelso were at a loss to know 
how to proceed to find him.</p>
<p>At the time of the murder, the only inmates of the house were Washington
and Frederick Nathan, sons of the dead man, and Mrs. Kelly, the 
housekeeper, and her grown son, William Kelly.&nbsp; Had the murder been 
committed by any of these they must of necessity have stolen the missing 
articles, and as they had not left the house, must have destroyed or 
concealed them on the premises.&nbsp; Without the knowledge of these 
persons, Jourdan caused a rigid and thorough search of the house and lot to
be made from cellar to garret.&nbsp; Every crack and crevice, every nook 
and corner was rigidly and minutely searched by <!-- page 363--><a 
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>experienced 
persons.&nbsp; Even the furniture and carpets were examined, the flooring 
of the stable was taken up, the water-tank was emptied, the basins, 
closets, and waste-pipes of the house were flushed, and the street-sewers 
were examined for a long distance from the house, but no trace of the 
missing articles could be found; nor could any mark of the 
&ldquo;dog&rdquo; be discovered anywhere save on the body of the 
victim.&nbsp; One by one, the inmates of the house were subjected to the 
most searching cross-examination, and within six hours after the discovery 
of the deed, Captain Jourdan was satisfied that the inmates of the mansion 
were entirely innocent of the crime.&nbsp; The evidence drawn out by the 
inquest subsequently confirmed the innocence of these parties.</p>
<p>The only clew left by the assassin was the &ldquo;dog.&rdquo;&nbsp; At 
the inquest, the policeman on the beat swore that when he passed the house 
on his rounds at half-past four A.M., he tried both front doors, and that 
they were fastened, and that when he passed again a little before six 
o&rsquo;clock, he noticed that the hall-door was closed.&nbsp; Another 
witness testified that about five o&rsquo;clock, a man in a laborer&rsquo;s
dress, carrying a dinner-pail, ascended the steps of the Nathan mansion, 
picked up a paper from the topmost step, and passed on down the 
street.&nbsp; The introduction of this man in the laborer&rsquo;s dress but
deepened the mystery and increased the labors of the Detectives.</p>
<p>The entire police force of the city was set to work watching the 
pawn-shops and jewelry stores where the thief might try to dispose of the 
stolen property.&nbsp; Every ship-yard and boat-yard was searched for the 
identification of the &ldquo;dog,&rdquo; but without success, and almost 
every mechanical establishment in the city where the instrument could have 
been used, was subjected to the same inspection, but without discovering 
anything.&nbsp; A list of the missing property, and the marks by which it 
could be identified, was given to the public and telegraphed all over the 
Union.&nbsp; Captain Jourdan declared that it was well to have as many 
people as possible looking for these articles.&nbsp; Every known or 
suspected criminal in the city was waited on by the police, and required to
give an account of himself on the night of the <!-- page 364--><a 
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>murder, and it is 
said that there was a general exodus of the professional thieves from New 
York.&nbsp; The ten days immediately succeeding the murder were singularly 
free from crime, so close was the espionage exercised over the criminals by
the police.</p>
<p>It is safe to assert that the police never made such exertions in all 
their history, to secure a criminal, as in this case.&nbsp; Every sensible 
suggestion was acted upon, no matter by whom tendered.&nbsp; Neither labor 
nor expense was spared, and all with the same result.&nbsp; Captain Jourdan
literally sank under his extraordinary exertions, his death, which occurred
on the 10th of October, 1870, being the result of his severe and exhausting
labors in this case.&nbsp; His successor, Superintendent Kelso, has been 
equally energetic, but thus far&mdash;nearly two years after the commission
of the deed&mdash;no more is known concerning it than was presented to 
Jourdan and Kelso as they stood in the chamber of death, and nothing has 
occurred to destroy or shake their original theory respecting the murderer 
and his mode of committing the deed.&nbsp; The mystery which enshrouded it 
on that sad July morning still hangs over it unbroken.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; PRIVATE DETECTIVES.</h3>
<p>The Detectives, whose ways we have been considering, are sworn officers 
of the law, and it is their prime duty to secure the arrest and 
imprisonment of offenders.&nbsp; There is another class of men in the city 
who are sometimes confounded with the regular force, but who really make it
their business to screen criminals from punishment.&nbsp; These men are 
called Private Detectives.&nbsp; Their task consists in tracing and 
recovering stolen property, watching suspected persons when hired to do so,
and manufacturing such evidence in suits and private cases as they may be 
employed to furnish.</p>
<p>There are several &ldquo;Private Detective Agencies&rdquo; in the city, 
all of which are conducted on very much the same principles <!-- page 
365--><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>and plan, 
and for the same purpose&mdash;to make money for the proprietors.&nbsp; Mr.
Edward Crapsey, to whom I am indebted for much of the information contained
in this chapter, thus describes a well-known Agency of this kind:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The visitor going up the broad stairs, finds himself in a large 
room, which is plainly the main office of the concern.&nbsp; There is a 
desk with the authoritative hedge of an iron railing, behind which sits a 
furrowed man, who looks an animated cork-screw, and who, the inquiring 
visitor soon discovers, can&rsquo;t speak above a whisper, or at least 
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; This mysterious person is always mistaken for the chief 
of the establishment, but, in fact, he is nothing but the 
&lsquo;Secretary,&rsquo; and holds his place by reason of a marvellous 
capacity for drawing people out of themselves.&nbsp; A mystery, he is 
surrounded with mysteries.&nbsp; The doors upon his right and 
left&mdash;one of which is occasionally opened just far enough to permit a 
very diminutive call-boy to be squeezed through&mdash;seem to lead to 
unexplored regions.&nbsp; But stranger than even the clerk, or the 
undefined but yet perfectly tangible weirdness of the doors is the tinkling
of a sepulchral bell, and the responsive tramp of a heavy-heeled 
boot.&nbsp; And strangest of all is a huge black board whereon are marked 
the figures from one to twenty, over some of which the word 
&lsquo;Out&rsquo; is written; and the visitor notices with ever-increasing 
wonder that the tinkling of the bell and the heavy-heeled tramp are usually
followed by the mysterious secretary&rsquo;s scrawling &lsquo;Out&rsquo; 
over another number, being apparently incited thereto by a whisper of the 
ghostly call-boy who is squeezed through a crack in the door for that 
purpose.&nbsp; The door which the call-boy abjures is always slightly ajar,
and at the aperture there is generally a wolfish eye glaring so steadily 
and rapaciously into the office as to raise a suspicion that beasts of prey
are crouching behind that forbidding door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor is the resulting alarm entirely groundless, for that is the 
room where the ferrets of the house who assume the name of Detectives, but 
are more significantly called &lsquo;shadows,&rsquo; are hidden from the 
prying eyes of the world.&nbsp; A &lsquo;shadow&rsquo; here is a mere 
numeral&mdash;No. 1, or something higher&mdash;and obeys <!-- page 366--><a
name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>cabalistic calls 
conveyed by bells or speaking-tubes, by which devices the stranger patron 
is convinced of the potency of the Detective Agency which moves in such 
mysterious ways to perform its wonders.&nbsp; If any doubt were left by all
this paraphernalia of marvel, it would be dispelled from the average mind 
when it came in contact with the chief conjuror, who is seated in the dim 
seclusion of a retired room, fortified by bell-pulls, speaking-tubes, and 
an owlish expression intended to be considered as the mirror of taciturn 
wisdom.&nbsp; From his retreat he moves the outside puppets of secretary, 
shadows, and call-boys, as the requirements of his patrons, who are 
admitted singly to his presence, may demand.&nbsp; It is he whose hoarse 
whispers sound sepulchrally through the tubes, who rings the mysterious 
bell, and by such complex means despatches his &lsquo;shadows&rsquo; upon 
their errands.&nbsp; It is he who permits the mildewed men in the other 
ante-room to be known only by numbers, and who guards them so carefully 
from the general view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By these assumptions of mystery the chief awes the patrons of his
peculiar calling, of whom there are pretty sure to be several in waiting 
during the morning hours.&nbsp; These applicants for detective assistance 
always sit stolidly silent until their separate summons comes to join the 
chief, eyeing each other suspiciously and surveying their surroundings with
unconcealed and fitting awe.&nbsp; One is of bluff and hearty appearance, 
but his full face is overcast for the moment with an expression half sad, 
half whimsical; it is plain that a conjunction of untoward circumstances 
has raised doubts in his mind of the integrity of a business associate, and
he has reluctantly determined to clear or confirm them by means of a 
&lsquo;shadow.&rsquo;&nbsp; Next to him is a fidgety furrowed man, 
bristling with suspicion in every line of his face, and showing by his air 
of indifference to his surroundings that he is a frequenter of the 
place.&nbsp; He is in fact one of the best customers of the establishment, 
as he is constantly invoking its aid in the petty concerns of his corroded 
life.&nbsp; Sometimes it is a wife, daughter, sister, niece, or a mere 
female acquaintance he wishes watched; sometimes it is a business partner 
or a rival in <!-- page 367--><a name="page367"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 367</span>trade he desires dogged; and he is never so 
miserable as when the reports of the agency show his suspicions, whatever 
they may have been, to be groundless.&nbsp; It is but just, however, to the
sagacity of the detectives to remark that he is seldom subjected to such 
disappointment.&nbsp; Whatever other foolishness they may commit, these 
adroit operators never kill the goose that lays their golden eggs.&nbsp; 
Beside this animated monument of distrust is a portly gentleman, his 
bearing in every way suggestive of plethoric pockets.&nbsp; Paper and 
pencil in hand, he is nervously figuring.&nbsp; He makes no secret of his 
figures because of his absorption, and a glance shows that he is correcting
the numbers of bonds and making sure of the amounts they represent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is plain that this last is a victim of a sneak robbery, and, 
the unerring scent of the chief selecting him as the most profitable 
customer of the morning, he is the first visitor called to an 
audience.&nbsp; Large affairs are quickly despatched, and it is soon 
arranged how a part of the property can be recovered and justice cheated of
its due.&nbsp; Very soon a handbill will be publicly distributed, offering 
a reward for the return of the bonds, and it will be signed by the 
Agency.&nbsp; The thief will know exactly what that means, and the affair 
being closed to mutual satisfaction, the thief will be at liberty to repeat
the operation, which resulted in reasonable profit and was attended with no
risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is also in the room a sallow, vinegary woman of uncertain 
years, and it seems so natural that a man should run away from her, we are 
not surprised that, being voluble in her grief, she declares her business 
to be the discovery of an absconding husband.&nbsp; But near her is another
and truer type of outraged womanhood, a wasted young wife, beautiful as 
ruins are beautiful, whom a rascal spendthrift has made a martyr to his 
selfishness until, patience and hope being exhausted, she is driven to the 
last extremity, and seeks by a means at which her nature revolts for a 
proof of but one of those numerous violations of the marriage vow which she
feels certain he has committed.&nbsp; It is a cruel resort, but the law 
which permits a man to outrage a woman in almost every other way frowns 
upon that one, and she is driven to it as the sole method of release from 
an <!-- page 368--><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
368</span>intolerable and degrading bondage.&nbsp; In such cases as this 
might perhaps be found some justification for the existence of private 
detectives; but they themselves do not appear to know that they stand in 
need of extenuation, and so neglect the opportunity thus presented to 
vindicate their necessity by conducting this class of their business with, 
even for them, remarkable lack of conscience.&nbsp; Anxious always to 
furnish exactly what is desired, their reports are often lies, manufactured
to suit the occasion, and once furnished they are stoutly adhered to, even 
to the last extremity.&nbsp; Frequently the same Agency is ready to and 
does serve both parties to a case with impartial wickedness, and earns its 
wages by giving to both precisely the sort of evidence each requires.&nbsp;
Sometimes it is made to order, with no other foundation than previous 
experience in like affairs; but sometimes it has a more solid basis in 
fact.&nbsp; Two men from the same office are often detailed to 
&lsquo;shadow,&rsquo; one the husband and the other the wife, and it 
occasionally happens that they have mastered the spirit of their calling so
thoroughly that they do a little business on private account by 
&lsquo;giving away&rsquo; each other.&nbsp; That is to say, the 
husband&rsquo;s man informs the wife she is watched, and gives her a minute
description of her &lsquo;shadow,&rsquo; for which information he of course
gets an adequate reward, which the wife&rsquo;s man likewise earns and 
receives by doing the same kindly office for the husband.&nbsp; In such 
cases there are generally mutual recriminations between the watched, which 
end in a discovery of the double dealing of the Agency, and not 
unfrequently in a reconciliation of the estranged couple.&nbsp; But this 
rare result, which is not intended by the directing power, is the sole good
purpose these agencies were ever known to serve.&nbsp; Lord Mansfield, it 
must be admitted, once seemed to justify the use of private detectives in 
divorce suits, but he was careful to cumber the faint praise with which he 
damned them by making honesty in the discharge of these delicate duties a 
first essential.&nbsp; Had he lived to see the iniquitous perfection the 
business has now attained, he would undoubtedly have withheld even that 
quasi-endorsement of a system naturally at war with the fundamental 
principles of justice.</p>
<p><!-- page 369--><a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
369</span>&ldquo;The waiters in the reception-room are never allowed to 
state their wants, or certainly not to leave the place, without being 
astonished by the charges made by the detective for attention to their 
business.&nbsp; Whatever differences there may be in minor matters, all 
these establishments are invariably true to the great purpose of their 
existence, and prepare the way for an exorbitant bill by a doleful 
explanation of the expenses and risks to be incurred in the special affair 
presented, dilating especially upon the rarity and cost of competent 
&lsquo;shadows.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now the principal agencies estimate for them 
at $10 a day, whereas these disreputable fellows are found in multitudes, 
and are rarely paid more than $3 a day as wages; their expenses, paid in 
advance by the patron, are allowed them when assigned to duties, as they 
frequently are, involving outlay.&nbsp; The general truth is that these 
agencies, being conducted for the avowed purpose of making money, get as 
much as possible for doing work, and pay as little as possible for having 
it done.&nbsp; In their general business of espionage they may make perhaps
only a moderate profit on each affair they take in hand; but in the more 
delicate branches of compounding felonies and manufacturing witnesses fancy
prices obtain, and the profits are not computable.&nbsp; It is plain, 
knowing of these patrons and prices, that reasonable profit attends upon 
the practice of the convenient science of getting without giving, which, 
notwithstanding its prosperity and antiquity, is yet an infant in the 
perfection it has attained.&nbsp; Awkward, flimsy, transparent as they ever
were, are yet the tricks and devices of the knaves who never want for a 
dollar, never earn an honest one, but never render themselves amenable to 
any statute &lsquo;in such case made and provided.&rsquo;&nbsp; To say that
the master-workmen in roguery who do this sort of thing are awkward and 
transparent seems to involve a paradox; but whoever so believes has not 
been fully informed as to the amazing gullibility of mankind.&nbsp; The 
average man of business now, as always before, seems to live only to be 
swindled by the same specious artifices that gulled his ancestors, and 
which will answer to pluck him again almost before the smart of his first 
depletion has ceased.&nbsp; Only by a thorough knowledge of this singular 
adaptation of the masses to <!-- page 370--><a name="page370"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 370</span>the purposes of the birds of prey, can we 
intelligently account for the vast bevies of the latter which exist, and 
are outwardly so sleek as to give evidence of a prosperous condition.&nbsp;
When we know that the &lsquo;pocket-book dropper&rsquo; yet decoys the 
money even of the city-bred by his stale device; that the 
&lsquo;gift-enterprises,&rsquo; &lsquo;envelope-game,&rsquo; and similar 
thread-bare tricks yet serve to attain the ends of the sharpers, although 
the public has been warned scores and scores of times through the public 
press, and the swindlers thoroughly exposed, so that the veriest fool can 
understand the deception, we need not be amazed at the success which 
attends the practice of these arts.&nbsp; The truth is, that a large 
proportion of the victims are perfectly aware that fleecing is intended 
when they flutter round the bait of the rogues; but they are allured by the
glitter of sudden fortune which it offers, and bite eagerly with the hope 
that may be supposed to sustain any gudgeon of moderate experience of 
snapping the bait and escaping the barbed hook.&nbsp; Human greed is the 
reliance of the general sharper, and it has served him to excellent purpose
for many years.&nbsp; But some of these operators must depend on actuating 
motives far different from the desire of gain in money; and chief among 
them are these private detectives, who draw their sustenance from meaner 
and equally unfailing fountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not upon record who bestowed a name which is more apt than 
designations usually are.&nbsp; The word detective, taken by itself, 
implies one who must descend to questionable shifts to attain justifiable 
ends; but with the prefix of private, it means one using a machine 
permitted to the exigencies of justice for the purpose of surreptitious 
personal gain.&nbsp; Thus used, this agency, which even in honest hands and
for lawful ends is one of doubtful propriety, becomes essentially dangerous
and demoralizing.&nbsp; Originally an individual enterprise, the last 
resort of plausible rascals driven to desperation to evade honest labor, it
has come to be one of associated effort, employing much capital in its 
establishment and some capacity in its direction.&nbsp; All the large 
commercial cities are now liberally provided with &lsquo;Detective 
Agencies,&rsquo; as they are called, each thoroughly organized, and some of
them employing a large number of &lsquo;shadows&rsquo; to do the <!-- page 
371--><a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 371</span>business, 
which in large part they must first create before it can be done.&nbsp; The
system being perfected and worked to its utmost capacity, the details of 
the tasks assumed and the method of accomplishment are astonishing and 
alarming to the reflecting citizen, who has the good name and well-being of
the community at heart.&nbsp; Employed in the mercantile world as supposed 
guards against loss by unfaithful associates or employ&eacute;s, and in 
social life as searchers for domestic laxness, these two items make up the 
bulk of the business which the private detectives profess to do, and 
through these their pernicious influence is felt in all the relations of 
life.&nbsp; Were they however only the instruments of rapacious and 
unreasoning distrust, they might be suffered to pass without rebuke as 
evils affecting only those who choose to meddle with them; but as they go 
further, and the community fares worse because they are ever ready to turn 
a dishonest penny by recovering stolen property, which they can only do by 
compounding the crime by which it had been acquired, it is evident that 
they are a peril to society in general no less than a pest to particular 
classes.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 372--><a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
372</span>XXII.&nbsp; WILLIAM B. ASTOR.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. William B. Astor</span> would be unknown to fame
were it not for two things.&nbsp; First, he is &ldquo;the son of his 
father,&rdquo; the famous John Jacob Astor.&nbsp; Second, he is the richest
citizen of the United States.&nbsp; In other respects, he is a plain, 
unpretending man, who attends closely to his own business, and cares 
nothing for notoriety.</p>
<p>Mr. Astor is the second son of John Jacob Astor, and is about 
seventy-three years old.&nbsp; He was born in New York, in an old-fashioned
brick house which stood on the southern corner of Broadway and Vesey 
street, a site at present covered by the Astor House.&nbsp; He received a 
careful education, and upon leaving college was sent by his father to 
travel through Europe.&nbsp; Upon his return he went into business with his
father, and it is said was even more thrifty and energetic in the 
management of their affairs than the old gentleman himself.&nbsp; The 
severe affliction of his elder brother made him the principal heir of his 
father&rsquo;s vast estate, but he lost no opportunity of bettering his own
condition, and at the death of the elder Astor, he was worth about 
$6,000,000 of his own.&nbsp; About $500,000 of this he had inherited from 
his uncle Henry Astor, a wealthy butcher of New York.&nbsp; His father left
him the bulk of his fortune, which made him the richest man in America, and
since then he has devoted himself with great success to increasing the 
amount of his possessions.&nbsp; His wealth is variously estimated at from 
$60,000,000, to $100,000,000.&nbsp; No one but the fortunate possessor can 
tell the exact amount.&nbsp; The greater part of this is invested in real 
estate, much of which is very profitable.&nbsp; A large part, however, is 
unimproved, and brings in no immediate <!-- page 373--><a 
name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>return.&nbsp; Mr. 
Astor, however, can afford to wait, and as there is no better judge of the 
prospective value of real estate in New York, he rarely makes a mistake in 
his purchases.&nbsp; He invests cautiously, allows others to improve the 
neighborhoods in which his property lies, and reaps the benefit of their 
labors.</p>
<p>In person Mr. Astor is tall and heavily built, with a decided German 
look, a dull, unintellectual face, and a cold, reserved manner.&nbsp; He is
unlike his father in many of his personal traits.&nbsp; He lives very 
simply.&nbsp; His residence is a plain, but substantial-looking brick 
mansion in Lafayette Place, adjoining the Astor Library.&nbsp; He is not 
very sociable, but the entertainments given at his house are said to be 
among the pleasantest and most elaborate to be met with in the city.&nbsp; 
Those who know the family, however, give the credit of this to Mrs. Astor, 
an amiable and accomplished lady, and one eminent for her good deeds.</p>
<p>Mr. Astor attends to his own business.&nbsp; His office is in Prince 
street, just out of Broadway.&nbsp; It is a plain one-story building, very 
different from the offices of most of the rich men of the metropolis.&nbsp;
At ten o&rsquo;clock Mr. Astor makes his appearance here.&nbsp; It is no 
slight task to manage so vast an estate, and to direct all its affairs so 
that they shall be continually increasing the capital of the owner.&nbsp; 
There is scarcely a laborer in the city who works harder than the master of
this office.&nbsp; He transacts all business connected with his estate, and
is as cold and curt in his manner as can well be imagined.&nbsp; He wastes 
neither words nor time, and few persons find him an agreeable man to deal 
with.&nbsp; He is perfectly informed respecting every detail of his vast 
business, and it is impossible to deceive him.&nbsp; No tenant can make the
slightest improvement, change, or repair in his property without Mr. 
Astor&rsquo;s consent, except at his own expense.&nbsp; He is accessible to
all who have business with him, but he sees no one else during his working 
hours.&nbsp; At four o&rsquo;clock he leaves his office, and sets out for 
home on foot.&nbsp; He rarely rides, this walk being his principal 
exercise.&nbsp; He is hale and hearty in constitution, looks much younger 
than he really is, and will doubtless live to be fully as old as his father
was at the time of his death.</p>
<p><!-- page 374--><a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
374</span>Mr. Astor is not regarded as a liberal man by his 
fellow-citizens, but this reputation is not altogether deserved.&nbsp; His 
friends say that he gives liberally when he gives at all.&nbsp; They add 
that he has a horror of subscription lists and solicitors of donations, and
that he turns a deaf ear to common beggars.&nbsp; He makes it a rule never 
to give anything during business hours.&nbsp; If a case interests him, he 
investigates it thoroughly, and if it is found worthy of aid, he gives 
generously, but quietly.&nbsp; The truth is, that like all rich men, he is 
beset by a host of beggars of every class and description.&nbsp; Were he to
grant every appeal addressed to him, his vast fortune would melt away in a 
few years.&nbsp; He must discriminate, and he has his own way of doing 
it.</p>
<p>Mr. Astor married a daughter of General Armstrong, the Secretary of War 
in Mr. Madison&rsquo;s cabinet.&nbsp; He has two sons, who are themselves 
fathers of families.&nbsp; They are John Jacob and William B. Astor, 
Jr.&nbsp; He has also several daughters, all married.&nbsp; The sons reside
on Fifth avenue.&nbsp; They are in active business for themselves.&nbsp; 
John Jacob, the elder, is a large-framed, heavy-boned man, and resembles 
his father.&nbsp; William B. Astor, Jr., is a small, slim man, and 
resembles his mother.&nbsp; They are much more sociable than their father, 
inheriting much of the genial vivacity of their grandfather, who was very 
fond of the pleasures of society.&nbsp; They are shrewd, energetic business
men, and it is said are very wealthy, independent of their father.&nbsp; 
Mr. John Jacob Astor entered the United States Army during the civil war, 
and saw considerable active service on the staff of General McClellan.</p>

375</span>XXIII.&nbsp; FASHIONABLE SHOPPING.</h2>
<p>The fashionable retail stores of New York lie chiefly along Broadway, 
between the St. Nicholas Hotel and Thirty-fourth street.&nbsp; A few are to
be found in the cross streets leading from the great thoroughfare, and some
are in the Sixth avenue, but Broadway almost monopolizes the fashionable 
retail trade of the city.&nbsp; All the large stores are conducted on the 
same general plan, the main object of which is to secure the greatest 
convenience and comfort for the purchaser, and the greatest dispatch and 
promptness on the part of the employ&eacute;s.&nbsp; The leading stores of 
the city have an established reputation with the citizens.&nbsp; They 
furnish a better class of goods than can be found elsewhere, and are the 
most reasonable in their prices.&nbsp; Furthermore, the purchaser may rely 
upon the assurances of the salesman concerning the goods.&nbsp; The 
salesmen in such houses are not allowed to represent anything as better 
than it really is.&nbsp; This certainty is worth a great deal to the 
purchaser, who is often incapable of judging intelligently of his 
purchase.&nbsp; The writer can assert, from actual experience, that for the
same amount of money one can buy at the first-class stores a better article
than is offered in the so-called &ldquo;cheap stores.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
377</span>Upon entering a first-class dry-goods store in New York, a 
stranger is impressed with the order and system which prevail throughout 
the whole establishment.&nbsp; The heavy plate glass door is opened for him
by a small boy in entering and departing.&nbsp; If the weather be stormy 
and the visitor has a wet umbrella, he may leave it in charge of the 
aforesaid boy, who gives him a check for it.&nbsp; He can reclaim it at any
time by presenting this check.&nbsp; As he enters he is met at the door by 
a well-dressed gentleman of easy address, who politely inquires what he 
wishes to purchase.&nbsp; Upon stating his business, he is promptly shown 
to the department in which the desired articles are kept, and the eye of 
the conductor is never removed from him until he has attracted the 
attention of the clerk from whom he makes his purchase.&nbsp; All this is 
done, however, without allowing him to see that he is watched.&nbsp; This 
espionage is necessary to guard against robbery.&nbsp; The city merchants 
are greatly annoyed, and are often subjected to heavy loss, by professional
shoplifters, who throng their stores.&nbsp; The shoplifters do not 
constitute the only thieves, however.&nbsp; Women of respectable position, 
led on by their mad passion for dress, have been detected in taking small 
but costly articles, such as laces, handkerchiefs, etc., from some of the 
principal houses.&nbsp; Such matters have usually been &ldquo;hushed 
up&rdquo; through the influence of the friends of the offender.&nbsp; The 
opportunities for theft are very great in the city stores.&nbsp; Hundreds 
of small articles, many of them of considerable value, lie within easy 
reach of the customers, and all the employ&eacute;s are obliged to exert 
the greatest watchfulness.&nbsp; Private detectives are employed by the 
principal houses, and as soon as a professional shoplifter enters, he or 
she is warned off the premises by the detective, whose experience enables 
him to recognize such persons at a glance.&nbsp; A refusal to profit by 
this warning is followed by a summary arrest.</p>
<p>The salesmen are not allowed to receive the pay for their sales.&nbsp; 
They take the purchaser&rsquo;s money, make a memorandum in duplicate of 
the sale, and hand both the papers and the money to a small boy who takes 
it to the cashier.&nbsp; If any change is due the purchaser, the boy brings
it back.&nbsp; The articles are also remeasured by the clerks who do them 
up in parcels, to see if the quantity is correct.&nbsp; The purchase is 
then delivered to the buyer, or sent to his residence.&nbsp; Thus the house
is furnished with a check on all dishonest salesmen, and at the same time 
acquires accurate knowledge of their labors in their respective 
departments.</p>
<p>The small boys referred to are called &ldquo;cash boys,&rdquo; and are 
now a necessity in a well regulated establishment.&nbsp; Good, steady <!-- 
page 378--><a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>cash 
boys are almost always in demand.&nbsp; Intelligence commands a premium in 
this department, and a bright, well recommended lad will generally be taken
on trial.&nbsp; He starts out with a salary of $3 per week.&nbsp; If he 
shows capacity, he is promoted as rapidly as possible.&nbsp; The highest 
salary paid to a cash boy is $8 per week, but one who earns this amount 
does not stay long in this position.&nbsp; He is soon made a salesman, and 
may then go as high in the house as his abilities will carry him.&nbsp; 
These boys generally have a bright and lively appearance.&nbsp; Besides 
acting as cash boys, they are sometimes sent on errands, they attend the 
doors, and do sundry other useful acts.&nbsp; They are strictly watched, 
and any improper conduct is punished with an instantaneous dismissal.&nbsp;
They generally belong to respectable families, and live at home with their 
parents.&nbsp; Many of them attend the night schools after business hours, 
and thus prepare for the great life struggle which is before them.&nbsp; 
Such boys are apt to do well in the world.&nbsp; Many, however, after being
released from the stores, imitate the ways of the clerks and 
salesmen.&nbsp; They affect a fastness which is painful to see in boys so 
young.&nbsp; They sport an abundance of flashy jewelry, patronize the cheap
places of amusement, and are seen in the low concert saloons, and other 
vile dens of the city.&nbsp; It is not difficult to predict the future of 
these boys.</p>
<p>The principal retail dry goods stores of New York are those of A. T. 
Stewart &amp; Co., Lord &amp; Taylor, Arnold, Constable &amp; Co., and 
James McCreery &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The house of A. T. Stewart &amp; Co. is the best known to persons 
visiting the city.&nbsp; Indeed there are very few Americans who have not 
heard of and longed to visit &ldquo;Stewart&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, 
besides, the largest and most complete establishment of its kind in the 
world.&nbsp; It occupies the entire block bounded by Broadway, Fourth 
avenue, Ninth and Tenth streets.&nbsp; The principal front is on Broadway, 
and the public entrances are on that street and on the Fourth avenue.&nbsp;
The Ninth street entrances are reserved exclusively for the employ&eacute;s
of the house.&nbsp; Many persons speak of the edifice as a &ldquo;marble 
palace,&rdquo; but this is incorrect.&nbsp; It is constructed of iron, in 
the style of arcade upon <!-- page 379--><a name="page379"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 379</span>arcade, and its fronts are so thickly studded 
with windows that they may be said to consist almost entirely of 
glass.&nbsp; It is five stories in height above the street, and above the 
fifth story there is an interior attic not visible from the sidewalk.&nbsp;
Below the street there is a basement and a sub-cellar, so that the monster 
building is really eight stories in height.&nbsp; There is no attempt at 
outward display, the fine effect of the edifice being due to its vast size 
and its symmetry.&nbsp; The interior is as simple.&nbsp; The floors are 
uncarpeted, the shelves are plain, as are the counters and the 
customers&rsquo; seats.&nbsp; The centre of the building is occupied by a 
large rotunda extending from the ground floor to the roof.&nbsp; All the 
upper floors are open around this rotunda.&nbsp; Two flights of massive 
stairs lead to the upper floors, and there are three handsome elevators for
the use of customers who do not care to make the journey on foot.&nbsp; 
Three other elevators on the Ninth street side are used for carrying 
goods.&nbsp; Each of the floors covers an area of about two acres, so that 
the whole establishment, including the cellar, occupies sixteen acres of 
space.</p>
<p>The cellar contains coal bins with a capacity of 500 tons.&nbsp; Close 
by are eight Harrison boilers of fifty horse power each, used for operating
the steam engines and warming the building with steam.&nbsp; There are in 
all ten steam engines located in this immense cellar.&nbsp; These are used 
for running the elevators, for working seven steam pumps, for feeding the 
boilers, and for forcing water up to the top floor, which is used as a 
laundry.&nbsp; In a certain part of the cellar is located the electrical 
battery, by means of which the gas jets in the building are lighted.&nbsp; 
Here are also rooms for the storage of goods.</p>
<p>The basement is occupied by the Carpet-making and Parcel 
departments.&nbsp; It is the largest room in the world, and is unbroken 
save by the light pillars which support the floors above.&nbsp; The 
Carpet-making department is interesting.&nbsp; The house deals largely in 
carpets, and one is surprised at the smallness of the force employed down 
here.&nbsp; The carpets purchased are cut, and the pieces matched as they 
lie on the floor by women.&nbsp; Then they are placed on a wide table, 
forty feet long, and are sewn <!-- page 380--><a name="page380"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 380</span>together by a machine worked by steam.&nbsp; 
This machine moves along the edge of the table, and the man operating it 
rides on it.&nbsp; His only care is to hold the parts to be sewn perfectly 
even, and the machine sews a seam of forty feet in from three to five 
minutes.</p>
<p>In the centre of the basement floor is a space about thirty feet square,
enclosed by counters.&nbsp; This is the Parcel department.&nbsp; All 
purchases to be sent to the buyer pass through this department, and these 
make up about ninety per cent. of the day&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; The 
purchases are sent here by the salesmen with a ticket affixed to each, 
stating the quantity and quality of the article bought, the amount paid, 
and the address of the buyer.&nbsp; The goods are then remeasured, and if 
an error has been made either in favor of or against the house, it is 
rectified.&nbsp; The goods are then made up in secure parcels, each of 
which is plainly marked with the address of the purchaser.&nbsp; These 
parcels are then turned over to the drivers of the wagons used by the house
for delivering purchases.&nbsp; The drivers are furnished with bills for 
the amounts to be collected on the parcels, and they are held to a rigid 
accountability for the delivery of every parcel entrusted to them, and the 
collection of all moneys due on them.</p>
<p>The ground floor is the principal salesroom.&nbsp; It is a simple, but 
elegant apartment, and its chief ornaments are the goods for sale, which 
are displayed in the most attractive and tasteful manner.&nbsp; The room is
300 by 200 feet in size.&nbsp; It contains 100 counters, with an aggregate 
length of 5000 feet.&nbsp; Behind these counters are low shelves on which 
the goods are kept.&nbsp; In the centre is the immense rotunda, and at 
various points are the little wooden pens enclosed with lattice work used 
by the cashiers.&nbsp; Each article for sale has its separate department, 
and there are thirty ushers on duty to direct purchasers where to find the 
articles they seek.&nbsp; The display of goods is magnificent, and includes
everything used for the clothing of ladies and children, either in the 
piece or ready made.&nbsp; There is also a department in which ladies and 
children may have all their clothing of every description made to 
order.</p>
<p><!-- page 381--><a name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
381</span>The second floor is used for the sale of ready-made clothing, 
suits, upholstery, etc., and the third floor is the carpet salesroom.&nbsp;
The other floors are closed to visitors, and are used as workshops, 
laundries, etc.</p>
<p>The convenience of having all these things, and in such great variety, 
under one roof is very great, and saves purchasers many a weary walk 
through the city.&nbsp; The immense capital employed by Mr. Stewart, and 
his great facilities of all kinds, enable him to control the markets in 
which he makes his purchases and to buy on terms which render it easy for 
him to undersell all his competitors.&nbsp; The smaller houses complain 
bitterly of this, and declare that he is ruining them.&nbsp; In spite of 
its immense trade, &ldquo;Stewart&rsquo;s&rdquo; is not the most popular 
place in the city with resident purchasers.&nbsp; The salesmen have the 
reputation of being rude and often insolent.&nbsp; There can be no doubt 
that, were specific complaints made, Mr. Stewart would administer the 
necessary punishment to the offender without delay; but as the offences 
complained of are chiefly a lack of civility, few care to complain.</p>
<p>The throng of visitors and purchasers is immense.&nbsp; They have been 
known to reach the enormous number of 50,000 in a single day; but the 
average is 15,000.&nbsp; Looking down from one of the upper floors, through
the rotunda, one can witness as busy and interesting a scene as New York 
affords.&nbsp; All kinds of people come here, from the poor woman whose 
scanty garb tells too plainly the story of her poverty, to the wife of the 
millionaire whose purchases amount to a small fortune, and all classes can 
be suited.</p>
<p>The sales of the house average about $60,000 per day, and have been 
known to reach $87,000.&nbsp; The bulk of the purchases is made between 
noon and five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The average daily sales of the principal
articles are as follows: Silks $15,000; dress goods, $6000; muslins, $3000;
laces, $2000; shawls, $2500; suits, $1000; calicoes, $1500; velvets, $2000;
gloves, $1000; furs, $1000; hosiery, $600; boys&rsquo; clothing, $700; 
Yankee notions, $600; embroideries, $1000; carpets, $5500.</p>

<p><!-- page 383--><a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
383</span>As may be supposed, the business of this great house requires an 
army of employ&eacute;s.&nbsp; The force consists of 1 general 
superintendent, 19 superintendents of departments, 9 cashiers, 25 
book-keepers, 30 ushers, 55 porters, 200 cash boys, 900 seamstresses, 
working-women, laundresses, etc., 320 salesmen and saleswomen, and 150 
salesmen and others in the carpet department, making a total of 1709 
persons.&nbsp; There are other persons employed about the establishment in 
various capacities, and these, with the extra help often employed, make the
aggregate frequently as much as 2200 persons.&nbsp; The business of the 
house opens at seven A.M., and closes at seven P.M.&nbsp; All the 
employ&eacute;s have thirty minutes allowed them for dinner.&nbsp; One half
of all are alternately dismissed at six o&rsquo;clock each evening.&nbsp; 
All the employ&eacute;s, when leaving, must pass through a private door on 
Ninth street.&nbsp; On each side of this door is a detective of great 
experience, whose business it is to see that none of the employ&eacute;s 
carry away with them any of the property of the house.&nbsp; The discipline
of the establishment is very rigid, and is enforced by a system of fines 
and other penalties.</p>
<p>The general management of the house is entrusted to Mr. Tellur, the 
General Superintendent, but Mr. Stewart gives it his personal supervision 
as well.&nbsp; He comes to the store every morning at ten o&rsquo;clock 
precisely, and consults with Mr. Tellur about the business of the previous 
day, and the wants of that just opening.&nbsp; He goes through the entire 
establishment, and personally acquaints himself with the exact condition of
the business.&nbsp; He knows everything connected with the retail store, 
and every detail of its management receives his constant supervision, and 
is conducted in accordance with his instructions.&nbsp; He remains here 
about an hour and a half in the morning, and returns at five o&rsquo;clock 
in the afternoon, and spends half an hour more.&nbsp; The rest of his 
working day is passed at his lower store.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Lord &amp; Taylor rank next to Stewart, and are a more popular firm with
residents than the latter.&nbsp; They occupy a magnificent iron building at
the corner of Broadway and Twentieth street.&nbsp; It is one of the finest 
and most picturesque edifices in the city, and is filled with a stock of 
goods equal in costliness and superior <!-- page 385--><a 
name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>in taste to anything 
that can be bought at Stewart&rsquo;s.&nbsp; On &ldquo;opening days,&rdquo;
or days when the merchants set out their finest goods for the inspection of
the public, Lord &amp; Taylor generally carry off the palm, for the 
handsomest and most tasteful display.&nbsp; The show windows of this house 
are among the sights of Broadway.</p>
<p>Two blocks below, on the same side of Broadway, is a row of magnificent 
white marble stores.&nbsp; The upper end, comprising about one-third of the
entire block, is occupied by Messrs. Arnold, Constable &amp; Co., a popular
and wealthy house.&nbsp; They are noted for the taste and general 
excellence of their goods.</p>
<p>James McCreery &amp; Co., at the corner of Broadway and Eleventh street,
occupy a part of the ground floor of the magnificent edifice of the 
Methodist Book Concern.&nbsp; They do not make as extensive a display as 
their competitors, but are well known in the city for their rich and 
elegant goods.&nbsp; The ball and wedding dresses imported and made by this
house are among the richest ever seen in New York.</p>
<h2><!-- page 386--><a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
386</span>XXIV.&nbsp; BLEECKER STREET.</h2>
<p>Perhaps very few people out of the great city know Bleecker Street at 
all; perhaps they have passed it a dozen times or more without noticing it,
or if they have marked it at all have regarded it only as a passably 
good-looking street going to decay.&nbsp; But he who does not know Bleecker
street does not know New York.&nbsp; It is of all the localities of the 
metropolis one of the best worth studying.</p>
<p>It was once the abode of wealth and fashion, as its fine old time 
mansions testify.&nbsp; Then Broadway north of it was the very centre of 
the aristocracy of the island, and Bond street was a primitive Fifth 
avenue.&nbsp; Going west from the Bowery, nearly to Sixth avenue, you will 
find rows of stately mansions on either hand, which speak eloquently of 
greatness gone, and as eloquently of hard times present.&nbsp; They have a 
strange aspect too, and one may read their story at a glance.&nbsp; 
Twenty-five years ago they were homes of wealth and refinement.&nbsp; The 
most sumptuous hospitality was dispensed here, and the stately drawing 
rooms often welcomed brilliant assemblages.&nbsp; Now a profusion of signs 
announce that hospitality is to be had at a stated price, and the old 
mansions are put to the viler uses of third-rate boarding houses and 
restaurants.</p>
<p>In many respects Bleecker street is more characteristic of Paris than of
New York.&nbsp; It reminds one strongly of the Latin Quarter, and one 
instinctively turns to look for the <i>Closerie des Lilas</i>.&nbsp; It is 
the headquarters of Bohemianism, and Mrs. Grundy now shivers with holy 
horror when she thinks it was once her home.&nbsp; The street has not 
entirely lost its reputation.&nbsp; No one is prepared to say it is a vile 
neighborhood; no one <!-- page 387--><a name="page387"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 387</span>would care to class it with Houston, Mercer, 
Greene, or Water streets; but people shake their heads, look mysterious, 
and sigh ominously when you ask them about it.&nbsp; It is a suspicious 
neighborhood, to say the least, and he who frequents it must be prepared 
for the gossip and surmises of his friends.&nbsp; No one but its denizens, 
whose discretion can be absolutely trusted, knows anything with certainty 
about its doings or mode of life, but every one has his own opinion.&nbsp; 
Walk down it at almost any hour of the day or night, and you will see many 
things that are new to you.&nbsp; Strange characters meet you at every 
step; even the shops have a Bohemian aspect, for trade is nowhere so much 
the victim of chance as here.&nbsp; You see no breach of the public peace, 
no indecorous act offends you; but the people you meet have a certain air 
of independence, of scorn, of conventionality, a certain carelessness which
mark them as very different from the throng you have just left on 
Broadway.&nbsp; They puzzle you, and set you to conjecturing who they are 
and what they are, and you find yourself weaving a romance about nearly 
every man or woman you meet.</p>
<p>That long-haired, queerly dressed young man, with a parcel under his 
arm, who passed you just then, is an artist, and his home is in the attic 
of that tall house from which you saw him pass out.&nbsp; It is a cheerless
place, indeed, and hardly the home for a devotee of the Muse; but the 
artist is a philosopher, and he flatters himself that if the world has not 
given him a share of its good things, it has at least freed him from its 
restraints, and so long as he has the necessaries of life and a lot of 
jolly good fellows to smoke and drink and chat with him in that lofty 
dwelling place of his, he is content to take life as he finds it.</p>
<p>If you look up to the second floor, you may see a pretty, but not over 
fresh looking young woman, gazing down into the street.&nbsp; She meets 
your glance with composure, and with an expression which is a half 
invitation to &ldquo;come up.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is used to looking at men, 
and to having them look at her, and she is not averse to their 
admiration.&nbsp; Her dress is a little flashy, and the traces of rouge are
rather too strong on her face, but it is not a bad face.&nbsp; You may see 
her to-night at the --- Theatre, <!-- page 388--><a 
name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 388</span>where she is the 
favorite.&nbsp; Not much of an actress, really, but very clever at winning 
over the dramatic critics of the great dailies who are but men, and not 
proof against feminine arts.&nbsp; This is her home, and an honest home, 
too.&nbsp; To be sure it would be better had she a mother or a brother, or 
husband&mdash;some recognized protector, who could save her from the 
&ldquo;misfortune of living alone;&rdquo; but this is Bleecker street, and 
she may live here according to her own fancy, &ldquo;and no questions 
asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the floor above her dwells Betty Mulligan, a pretty little butterfly 
well known to the lovers of the ballet as Mademoiselle Alexandrine.&nbsp; 
No one pretends to know her history.&nbsp; She pays her room rent, has 
hosts of friends, but beyond this no one knows anything.&nbsp; Surmises 
there are by the score, and people wonder how mademoiselle can live so well
on her little salary; but no charges are made.&nbsp; People shrug their 
shoulders, and hint that ballet girls have resources unknown to the 
uninitiated.&nbsp; The rule here is that every one must look after himself,
and it requires such an effort to do this that there is no time left to 
watch a neighbor&rsquo;s shortcomings.</p>
<p>In the same house is a fine-looking woman, not young, but not old.&nbsp;
Her &ldquo;husband&rdquo; has taken lodgings here for her, but he comes to 
see her only at intervals, and he is not counted in the landlady&rsquo;s 
bill.&nbsp; Business keeps him away, and he comes when he can.&nbsp; 
Bleecker street never asks madame for her marriage certificate, nor does it
seek to know why her numerous friends are all gentlemen, or why they come 
only when the &ldquo;husband&rdquo; is away.</p>
<p>Honest, hard-working men come here with their families.&nbsp; Their 
earnings are regular, but small, and they prefer the life of this street to
the misery of the tenement house.&nbsp; Others there are who live in the 
street, and occupy whole dwellings with their families, who stay here from 
force of habit.&nbsp; They are &ldquo;slow&rdquo; people, dull of 
comprehension, and to them the mysteries of their neighborhood are a sealed
book.&nbsp; Yet all are regarded as persons whose characters are &ldquo;not
proven,&rdquo; by the dwellers outside the street.</p>
<p><!-- page 389--><a name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
389</span>Money is a power in Bleecker street.&nbsp; It will purchase 
anything.&nbsp; Much is spent by those who do not dwell here, but come here
to hide their secrets.&nbsp; Women come here to meet other men besides 
their husbands, and men bring women here who are not their wives.&nbsp; 
Bleecker street asks no questions, but it has come to suspect the men and 
women who are seen in it.</p>
<p>Indeed, so long as its tenants do not violate the written law of the 
land to an extent sufficient to warrant the interference of the police, 
they may do as they please.&nbsp; Thus it has come to pass that the various
personages who are a law unto themselves have gradually drifted into 
Bleecker street, unless they can afford better quarters, and even then the 
freedom of the locality has for them a fascination hard to be 
resisted.&nbsp; No one loses caste here for any irregularity.&nbsp; You may
dress as you please, live as you please, do as you please in all things, 
and no comments will be made.&nbsp; There is no &ldquo;society&rdquo; here 
to worry your life with its claims and laws.&nbsp; You are a law unto 
yourself.&nbsp; Your acts are exclusively your own business.&nbsp; No 
complaints will be made against you.&nbsp; You are absolutely your own 
master or mistress here.&nbsp; Life here is based on principles which 
differ from those which prevail in other parts of the city.</p>
<p>Yet, as I have said, no one dare call the street 
&ldquo;bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us say it is &ldquo;irregular,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;free,&rdquo; &ldquo;above scandal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;superior to 
criticism;&rdquo; but let us not venture to term it &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; as 
its neighbors Greene and Mercer are &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot say 
it would be shocked by such a charge, for Bleecker street is never shocked 
at anything.&nbsp; It would, no doubt, laugh in our faces, and scornfully 
ask for our proofs of its badness, and proofs of this sort are hard to 
bring to light in this thoroughfare.</p>
<h2><!-- page 390--><a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
390</span>XXV.&nbsp; CEMETERIES.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; GREENWOOD.</h3>
<p>The most beautiful cemetery of the city of New York, and the place where
its people most long to sleep when &ldquo;life&rsquo;s fitful fever&rdquo; 
is over, is Greenwood.&nbsp; It is situated on Gowanus Heights, within the 
limits of the City of Brooklyn, and covers an area of 413 acres of 
land.&nbsp; It is two and a half miles distant from the South Ferry, and 
three from the Fulton Ferry, with lines of street cars from both 
ferries.&nbsp; A portion of the grounds is historic, for along the edge of 
the heights occurred the hardest fighting in the battle of Long Island, in 
1776.</p>
<p>The cemetery is beautifully laid out.&nbsp; The heights have been graded
at immense expense, and the grounds are provided with carriage roads built 
of stone, covered with gravel, and with foot-paths of concrete.&nbsp; The 
carriage drives are seventeen miles, and the foot-paths fifteen miles in 
extent.&nbsp; The sewerage is perfect, and the greatest care is exercised 
in keeping the grounds free from dirt and weeds.&nbsp; The cemetery was 
laid out under the supervision of a corps of accomplished landscape 
gardeners, and it abounds in the most exquisite scenery.&nbsp; From the 
higher portions the bay and the cities which border it, with the blue ocean
in the distance, may all be seen.&nbsp; Everything that art could do to add
to the attractions of a naturally beautiful spot has been done, and the 
place has come to be, next to the Central and Prospect Parks, one of the 
favorite resorts of the people of New York and Brooklyn.&nbsp; The 
entrances are all adorned with <!-- page 391--><a name="page391"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 391</span>magnificent gateways of stone.&nbsp; The 
northern gateway is adorned with sculptures representing the burial of the 
Saviour, and the raising of the widow&rsquo;s son and of Lazarus.&nbsp; 
Above these are bas-relief figures, representing Faith, Hope, Memory, and 
Love.</p>
<p>The cemetery was opened for burials about twenty-seven years ago.&nbsp; 
At the close of the year 1870 the interments had reached 150,000.&nbsp; 
From fifteen to twenty interments are made here every day.&nbsp; The 
deep-toned bell of the great gateway is forever tolling its knell, and some
mournful train is forever wending its slow way under the beautiful 
trees.&nbsp; Yet the sunlight falls brightly, the birds sing their sweetest
over the new-made graves, the wind sighs its dirge through the tall trees, 
and the &ldquo;sad sea waves&rdquo; blend with it all their solemn 
undertone from afar.</p>
<p>The tombs and monuments to be seen at Greenwood are very 
beautiful.&nbsp; Some of them are noted as works of art.&nbsp; Many of them
have cost from $10,000 to $100,000.&nbsp; About 2000 of these tombs are 
scattered through the grounds.&nbsp; In beauty of design and costliness 
they surpass any similar collection in the New World, but in one respect 
they are like all others, for they speak nothing but good of the 
dead.&nbsp; Indeed, were one to believe their inscriptions, the conclusion 
would be inevitable that none but saints are buried in Greenwood.&nbsp; All
classes come here, but the cemetery is characteristic of the living city 
beyond.&nbsp; Wealth governs everything here as there.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; CYPRESS HILLS.</h3>
<p>North of the Brooklyn and Jamaica Turnpike, is an elevated ridge known 
as the &ldquo;backbone of Long Island,&rdquo; and on this ridge, partly in 
Kings and partly in Queens counties, about five miles from the Catharine 
Street Ferry, is the Cemetery of Cypress Hills.&nbsp; It comprises an area 
of 400 acres, one-half of which is still covered with the native forest 
trees.&nbsp; The other <!-- page 392--><a name="page392"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 392</span>portion is handsomely adorned with shrubbery, 
and laid off tastefully.&nbsp; The entrance consists of a brick arch, 
surmounted by a statue of Faith.&nbsp; It rests on two beautiful lodges 
occupied by the gate-keeper and superintendent of the cemetery.</p>
<p>From the cemetery one may command an extensive view, embracing all the 
surrounding country, the cities of Brooklyn, New York, Jersey City, and 
Flushing, the Hudson as far as the Palisades, Long Island Sound, the 
distant hills of Connecticut, and the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the grounds, in 1848, upwards of 85,000 interments 
have been made here.&nbsp; Of these 4060 were officers and soldiers of the 
United States army, who were killed or who died during the Civil War.&nbsp;
They are buried in a section set apart for them.&nbsp; The Sons of 
Temperance, the Odd-Fellows, the Masons, and the Police Forces of New York 
and Brooklyn have sections of their own here.&nbsp; When the old 
grave-yards of New York and Brooklyn were broken up, about 35,000 bodies 
were removed from them to these grounds.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; WOODLAWN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Woodlawn Cemetery</span> lies in Westchester County,
eight miles north of Harlem Bridge, and along the line of the New York, 
Harlem and Albany Railway.&nbsp; It is easily reached by means of this 
road.&nbsp; It was incorporated in 1863, and laid out in 1865.&nbsp; It 
comprises about 325 acres, and is naturally one of the most beautiful 
cemeteries used by the city.&nbsp; It is easier of access than Greenwood, 
there being no ferry to cross, and the Harlem Railway Company having 
instituted a system of funeral trains which convey funeral corteges to the 
entrance to the grounds.&nbsp; This, together with its natural beauty, is 
making it a favorite place of burial with the New Yorkers.&nbsp; The 
grounds are being rapidly improved, and, it is believed, will eventually 
rival Greenwood.&nbsp; Since its opening, in 1865, there have been nearly 
9000 interments in Woodlawn.&nbsp; Admiral Farragut was buried here in 
1871.&nbsp; The main avenue or boulevard from the <!-- page 393--><a 
name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 393</span>Central Park to White
Plains will pass through these grounds, and afford a broad and magnificent 
drive from the city to the cemetery.</p>
<h3>IV.&nbsp; CALVARY, AND THE EVERGREENS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Calvary Cemetery</span> is the property of the Roman
Catholic Church, and contains only the graves of those who have died in 
that faith.&nbsp; It is situated in the town of Newtown, Long Island, about
four miles from New York.&nbsp; It comprises about seventy-five acres, and 
was opened in August, 1848, since which time about 84,000 bodies have been 
buried in it.</p>
<p>The Cemetery of the Evergreens is situated about three miles and a half 
to the eastward of Williamsburg.&nbsp; It lies on the western end of a 
range of hills, and is one of the largest and most picturesque of all the 
cemeteries of New York.&nbsp; It is being steadily improved, and is growing
in favor with the people of the great cities at its feet.</p>
<p>Another burial ground once used by the people of New York, but now 
abandoned by them, is the New York Bay Cemetery, situated on the shore of 
the bay in the State of New Jersey, about two and a half miles from the 
Courtlandt Street Ferry.&nbsp; It comprises about fifty acres of ground, 
and contains 50,000 graves.</p>
<p>No burials are now permitted on Manhattan Island, except in the Cemetery
of Trinity Church, which lies at the intersection of Tenth avenue and 
One-hundred-and-fifty-fifth street.&nbsp; From Tenth avenue the grounds 
extend to the river.&nbsp; The new public drive passes through the 
cemetery, and has greatly injured it.&nbsp; The grounds comprise an area of
thirty-six acres, are beautifully laid off, and are shaded by fine 
trees.&nbsp; Among the persons buried here are Philip Livingston, a signer 
of the Declaration of Independence, Bishops Wainright and Onderdonk, Madame
Jumel, the last wife of Aaron Burr, Audubon, and John Jacob Astor.&nbsp; 
President Monroe was buried here, but his remains were removed to Richmond,
Virginia, in 1859.</p>
<h2><!-- page 394--><a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
394</span>XXVI.&nbsp; THE CLUBS.</h2>
<p>With respect to the number and attractiveness of its clubs, New York 
bids fair to rival London.&nbsp; They embrace associations for almost every
purpose, and are more or less successful according to their means and the 
object in view.&nbsp; Those for social enjoyment and intercourse are the 
most popular, and the best known.&nbsp; They are composed principally of 
men of fashion and wealth, and occupy some of the most elegant mansions in 
the city.</p>
<p>The best known are the Century, No. 109 East Fifteenth street; 
Manhattan, corner of Fifth avenue and Fifteenth street; Union League, 
corner of Madison avenue and Twenty-sixth street; Union, corner of 
Twenty-first street and Fifth avenue; Travellers&rsquo;, No. 222 Fifth 
avenue; Eclectic, corner of Twenty-sixth street and Fifth avenue; City, No.
31 East Seventeenth street; Harmonie, Forty-second street, west of Fifth 
avenue; Allemania, No. 18 East Sixteenth street; American Jockey Club, 
corner of Madison avenue and Twenty-seventh street; and New York Yacht 
Club, club-house on Staten Island.</p>
<p>The location of these clubs is very desirable.&nbsp; They are all in the
most fashionable quarter of the city, and their houses are in keeping with 
their surroundings.&nbsp; They are elegantly furnished, and often contain 
valuable and beautiful works of art.&nbsp; Some are owned by the 
associations occupying them; others are rented at prices varying from $8000
to $20,000 per annum.&nbsp; The initiation fees range from $50 to $150, and
the annual dues from $50 to $100.&nbsp; The number of members varies from 
300 to 800, but in the best organizations the object is to avoid a large 
membership.&nbsp; Great care is taken in the investigation of the <!-- page
395--><a name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>history of 
applicants for membership, and none but persons of good reputation are 
admitted.&nbsp; In the most exclusive, one adverse ballot in ten is 
sufficient to negative an application for membership.</p>
<p>By the payment of the sums named above, members have all the benefits of
an elegant private hotel at a moderate cost, and are sure of enjoying the 
privacy which is so agreeable to cultivated tastes.&nbsp; They have 
constant opportunities of meeting with friends, and besides have a pleasant
lounging place in which to pass their leisure hours.</p>
<p>The Century Club stands at the head of the list.&nbsp; It is considered 
the most desirable association in the city, and numerous applications for 
places made vacant in it, are always on file.&nbsp; It occupies a handsome 
red brick mansion just out of Union Square, on East Fifteenth street.&nbsp;
It was organized more than thirty years ago, and was originally a sketch 
club, and its membership was rigidly confined to literary men and 
artists.&nbsp; Of late years, however, it has been thrown open to any 
gentleman who may be accepted by the members.&nbsp; Its President is 
William Cullen Bryant.&nbsp; Its roll of members includes men of all 
professions among them: Bayard Taylor, William Allan Butler, George William
Curtis, and Parke Goodwin, authors; Rev. Dr. Bellows and Dr. Osgood, 
clergymen; John Brougham, Lester Wallack, and Edwin Booth, actors; 
Bierstadt, Gignoux, Cropsey, Church, and Kensett, artists; William H. 
Appleton, publisher; and A. T. Stewart, John Jacob Astor, and August 
Belmont, capitalists.&nbsp; This club has no restaurant, and is conducted 
inexpensively.&nbsp; Its Saturday night gatherings bring together the most 
talented men in the city, and its receptions are among the events of the 
season.</p>
<p>The Manhattan Club is a political as well as a social 
organization.&nbsp; It is the head-quarters of Democrats of the better 
class.&nbsp; It numbers 600 members, about 100 of these residing out of the
city.&nbsp; It includes the leading Democratic politicians of the city and 
State, and when similar celebrities from other States are in the city they 
are generally entertained by the club, and have the freedom of the 
house.&nbsp; The club-house is a splendid <!-- page 396--><a 
name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 396</span>brown stone edifice, 
built originally for a private residence by a man named Parker.&nbsp; It 
stands on leased ground, and the building only is owned by the club, which 
paid $110,000 for it.&nbsp; The annual dues are $50.&nbsp; Members are 
supplied with meals at cost prices.&nbsp; Wines are furnished at similar 
charges.&nbsp; The restaurant has for its chief cook a Frenchman, who is 
said to be the most accomplished &ldquo;artist&rdquo; in New York.&nbsp; He
receives an annual salary of $1800.&nbsp; The house is palatial, but a 
trifle flashy in its appointments, and a more luxurious resort is not to be
found on the island.</p>
<p>The Union League Club is domiciled in a magnificent brick and marble 
mansion.&nbsp; It is also a political organization, and is not so exclusive
as the Manhattan as regards its membership.&nbsp; It is the headquarters of
the Republican leaders, and has perhaps the largest membership of any of 
the city clubs.&nbsp; It possesses a fine restaurant, conducted on club 
principles, a collection of works of art, a private theatre, and lodging 
rooms which may be used by the members upon certain conditions.</p>
<p>The Union Club is emphatically a rich man&rsquo;s association.&nbsp; Its
members are all men of great wealth, and its windows are always lined with 
idlers who seem to have nothing to do but to stare ladies passing by out of
countenance.&nbsp; The club house is one of the handsomest buildings in the
city, and its furniture and decorations are of the most costly 
description.</p>
<p>The Travellers&rsquo; Club was originally designed for affording its 
members an opportunity of meeting with distinguished travellers visiting 
the city.&nbsp; This object is still kept in view, but the club is becoming
more of a social organization than formerly.&nbsp; Travellers of note are 
invited to partake of its hospitalities upon arriving in the city, and 
frequently lecture before the club.</p>
<p>Many club members never see the interior of the club houses more than 
once or twice a year.&nbsp; They pay their dues, and remain on the rolls, 
but prefer their homes to the clubs.&nbsp; Others again pass a large part 
of their time in these elegant apartments in the society of congenial 
friends.&nbsp; Club life is not favorable to a fondness for home, and it is
not surprising that the ladies are among the bitterest opponents of the 
system.</p>
<p><!-- page 397--><a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
397</span>The ladies themselves, however, have their clubs.&nbsp; The most 
noted of these is the <i>Sorosis</i>, the object of which seems to be to 
bring together the strong-minded of the sex to enjoy a lunch at 
Delmonico&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Some of the most talented female writers of the 
country are members of the organization.&nbsp; It was stated in several of 
the city newspapers, about a year ago, that at one of the meetings of 
<i>Sorosis</i> the members became involved in a fierce dispute over some 
question concerning the management of the club, and that when the 
excitement became too intense for words, they relieved their overcharged 
feelings by &ldquo;a good cry all around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that there is another club in the city, made up of females of
nominal respectability, married and single, whose meetings have but one 
object&mdash;&ldquo;to have a good time.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is said that the 
good time embraces not a little hard drinking, and a still greater amount 
of scandal-monging, and that many of the &ldquo;leading ladies&rdquo; of 
the club make a habit of getting &ldquo;gloriously drunk&rdquo; at these 
meetings.&nbsp; A faithfully written account of the transactions of this 
club would no doubt furnish a fine article for the <i>Day&rsquo;s 
Doings</i>.</p>
<p>The Yacht Club consists of a number of wealthy gentlemen who are devoted
to salt-water sports.&nbsp; The club house is on Staten Island.&nbsp; The 
yachts of the members constitute one of the finest fleets of the kind in 
existence, and their annual regattas, which are held in the lower bay, are 
sights worth seeing.</p>

398</span>XXVII.&nbsp; THE FIVE POINTS.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; LIFE IN THE SHADOW.</h3>
<p>Just back of the City Hall, towards the East River, and within full 
sight of Broadway, is the terrible and wretched district known as the Five 
Points.&nbsp; You may stand in the open space at the intersection of Park 
and Worth streets, the true Five Points, in the midst of a wide sea of sin 
and suffering, and gaze right into Broadway with its marble palaces of 
trade, its busy, well-dressed throng, and its roar and bustle so indicative
of wealth and prosperity.&nbsp; It is almost within pistol shot, but what a
wide gulf lies between the two thoroughfares, a gulf that the wretched, 
shabby, dirty creatures who go slouching by you may never cross.&nbsp; 
There everything is bright and cheerful.&nbsp; Here every surrounding is 
dark and wretched.&nbsp; The streets are narrow and dirty, the dwellings 
are foul and gloomy, and the very air seems heavy with misery and 
crime.&nbsp; For many a block the scene is the same.&nbsp; This is the 
realm of Poverty.&nbsp; Here want and suffering, and vice hold their 
courts.&nbsp; It is a strange land to you who have known nothing but the 
upper and better quarters of the great city.&nbsp; It is a very terrible 
place to those who are forced to dwell in it.&nbsp; For many blocks to the 
north and south of where we stand in Worth street, and from Elm street back
to East River, the Five Points presents a succession of similar scenes of 
wretchedness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p399.jpg">
<img alt="A FIVE POINTS RUM SHOP." src="images/p399.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Yet, bad as it is, it was worse a few years ago.&nbsp; There was not 
more suffering, it is true, but crime was more frequent here.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 400--><a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 400</span>A 
respectably dressed man could not pass through this section twelve years 
ago without risking his safety or his life.&nbsp; Murders, robberies, and 
crimes of all kinds were numerous.&nbsp; Fugitives from justice found a 
sure refuge here, and the officers of the law frequently did not dare to 
seek them in their hiding places.&nbsp; Now, thanks to the march of trade 
up the island, the work of the missionaries, and the vigilance of the new 
police, the Five Points quarter is safe enough during the day.&nbsp; But 
still, there are some sections of it in which it is not prudent to venture 
at night.&nbsp; The criminal class no longer herd here, but have scattered 
themselves over the island, so that the quarter now contains really more 
suffering than crime.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago there stood in Park street, near Worth, a large 
dilapidated building known as the &ldquo;Old Brewery.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was 
almost in ruins, but it was the most densely populated building in the 
city.&nbsp; It is said to have contained at one time as many as 1200 
people.&nbsp; Its passages were long and dark, and it abounded in rooms of 
all sizes and descriptions, in many of which were secure hiding places for 
men and stolen goods.&nbsp; The occupants were chiefly the most desperate 
characters in New York, and the &ldquo;Old Brewery&rdquo; was everywhere 
recognized as the headquarters of crime in the metropolis.&nbsp; The narrow
thoroughfare extending around it was known as &ldquo;Murderers&rsquo; 
Alley&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Den of Thieves.&rdquo;&nbsp; No respectable 
person ever ventured near it, and even the officers of the law avoided it 
except when their duty compelled them to enter it.&nbsp; It was a terrible 
place.</p>
<p>Nor was the neighborhood in which this building was located any 
better.&nbsp; The ground was damp and marshy, the old Collect Pond having 
originally covered the site, and the streets were filthy beyond 
description.&nbsp; It is said that there were underground passages 
extending under the streets from some of the houses to others in different 
blocks, which were kept secret from all but professional criminals.&nbsp; 
These were used for facilitating the commission of crimes and the escape of
criminals.&nbsp; Brothels and rum shops abounded, and from morning until 
night brawls were going on in a dozen or more of them at once.</p>
<p><!-- page 401--><a name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
401</span>The locality is better now.&nbsp; In 1852, the Old Brewery was 
purchased by the <i>Ladies&rsquo; Home Missionary Society</i> of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, and was pulled down.&nbsp; Its site is now 
occupied by the neat and comfortable buildings of the <i>Five Points 
Mission</i>.&nbsp; Just across Worth street is the <i>Five Points House of 
Industry</i>, and business is creeping in slowly to change the character of
this immediate locality forever.</p>
<p>In speaking of the Five Points, I include the Fourth and Sixth Wards, 
which are generally regarded as constituting that section&mdash;probably 
because they are the most wretched and criminal of all in the city.&nbsp; 
This description will apply with almost equal force to a large part of the 
First Ward, lying along the North River side of the island.&nbsp; The 
Fourth and Sixth Wards are also among the most densely populated, being the
smallest wards in extent in the city.</p>
<p>The streets in this section are generally narrow and crooked.&nbsp; The 
gutters and the roadway are lined with filth, and from the dark, dingy 
houses comes up the most sickening stench.&nbsp; Every house is packed to 
its utmost capacity.&nbsp; In some are simply the poor, in others are those
whose reputations make the policemen careful in entering them.&nbsp; Some 
of these buildings are simply dens of thieves.&nbsp; All the streets are 
wretched enough, but Baxter street has of late years succeeded to the 
reputation formerly enjoyed by its neighbor, Park street.&nbsp; It is a 
narrow, crooked thoroughfare.&nbsp; The sidewalk is almost gone in many 
places, and the street is full of holes.&nbsp; Some of the buildings are of
brick, and are lofty enough for a modern Tower of Babel.&nbsp; Others are 
one and two story wooden shanties.&nbsp; All are hideously dirty.&nbsp; 
From Canal to Chatham street there is not the slightest sign of cleanliness
or comfort.&nbsp; From Franklin to Chatham street there is scarcely a house
without a bucket shop or &ldquo;distillery,&rdquo; as the signs over the 
door read, on the ground floor.&nbsp; Here the vilest and most poisonous 
compounds are sold as whiskey, gin, rum, and brandy.&nbsp; Their effects 
are visible on every hand.&nbsp; Some of these houses are brothels of the 
lowest description, and, ah, such terrible faces as look out upon you as 
you pass them by!&nbsp; Surely no more hopeless, crime-stained <!-- page 
402--><a name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 402</span>visages are 
to be seen this side of the home of the damned.&nbsp; The filth that is 
thrown into the street lies there and decays until the kindly heavens pour 
down a drenching shower and wash it away.&nbsp; As a natural consequence, 
the neighborhood is sickly, and sometimes the infection amounts almost to a
plague.</p>
<p>Between Fourteenth street and the Battery, half a million of people are 
crowded into about one-fifth of the island of Manhattan.&nbsp; Within this 
section there are about 13,000 tenement houses, fully one-half of which are
in bad condition, dirty and unhealthy.&nbsp; One small block of the Five 
Points district is said to contain 382 families.&nbsp; The most wretched 
tenement houses are to be found in the Five Points.&nbsp; The stairways are
rickety and groan and tremble beneath your tread.&nbsp; The entries are 
dark and foul.&nbsp; Some of these buildings have secret passages 
connecting them with others of a similar character.&nbsp; These passages 
are known only to criminals, and are used by them for their vile 
purposes.&nbsp; Offenders may safely hide from the police in these wretched
abodes.&nbsp; Every room is crowded with people.&nbsp; Sometimes as many as
a dozen are packed into a single apartment.&nbsp; Decency and morality soon
fade away here.&nbsp; Drunkenness is the general rule.&nbsp; Some of the 
dwellers here never leave their abodes, but remain in them the year round 
stupefied with liquor, to procure which their wives, husbands or children 
will beg or steal.&nbsp; Thousands of children are born here every year, 
and thousands happily die in the first few months of infancy.&nbsp; Those 
who survive rarely see the sun until they are able to crawl out into the 
streets.&nbsp; Both old and young die at a fearful rate.&nbsp; They inhale 
disease with every breath.</p>
<p>The exact number of vagrant and destitute children to be found in the 
Five Points is not known.&nbsp; There are thousands, however.&nbsp; Some 
have placed the estimate as high as 15,000, and some higher.&nbsp; They are
chiefly of foreign parentage.&nbsp; They do not attend the public schools, 
for they are too dirty and ragged.&nbsp; The poor little wretches have no 
friends but the attach&eacute;s of the missions.&nbsp; The missionaries do 
much for them, but they cannot aid all.&nbsp; Indeed, they frequently have 
great difficulty in inducing the parents of the children to allow them <!--
page 403--><a name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 403</span>to 
attend their schools.&nbsp; The parents are mostly of the Roman Catholic 
faith, and the clergy of that Church have from the first exerted their 
entire influence to destroy the missions, and put a stop to their 
work.&nbsp; They feared the effect of these establishments upon the minds 
of the children, and, strange as it may seem, preferred to let them starve 
in the street, or come to worse ending, rather than risk the effects of 
education and Protestant influence.&nbsp; To those who know what a great 
and blessed work these missions have done, this statement will no doubt be 
astounding.&nbsp; Yet it is true.</p>
<p>In spite of the missions, however, the lot of the majority of the Five 
Points children is very sad.&nbsp; Their parents are always poor, and 
unable to keep them in comfort.&nbsp; Too frequently they are drunken 
brutes, and then the life of the little one is simply miserable.&nbsp; In 
the morning the child is thrust out of its terrible home to pick rags, 
bones, cinders, or anything that can be used or sold, or to beg or steal, 
for many are carefully trained in dishonesty.&nbsp; They are disgustingly 
dirty, and all but the missionaries shrink from contact with them.&nbsp; 
The majority are old looking and ugly, but a few have bright, intelligent 
faces.&nbsp; From the time they are capable of receiving impressions, they 
are thrown into constant contact with vice and crime.&nbsp; They grow up to
acquire surely and steadily the ways of their elders.&nbsp; The boys 
recruit the ranks of the pickpockets, thieves, and murderers of the city; 
the girls become waiters in the concert halls, or street walkers, and 
thence go down to ruin, greater misery and death.</p>
<p>In winter and summer suffering is the lot of the Five Points.&nbsp; In 
the summer the heat is intense, and the inmates of the houses pour out into
the filthy streets to seek relief from the torture to which they are 
subjected indoors.&nbsp; In winter they are half frozen with cold.&nbsp; 
The missionaries and the police tell some dreary stories of this 
quarter.&nbsp; A writer in a city journal thus describes a visit made in 
company with the missionary of the Five Points House of Industry to one of 
these homes of sorrow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next place visited was a perfect hovel.&nbsp; Mr. Shultz, in 
<!-- page 404--><a name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
404</span>passing along a narrow dark hall leading towards the head of the 
stairs, knocked at an old door, through which the faintest ray of light was
struggling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said a voice on the opposite side 
of the room.&nbsp; The door being opened, a most sickening scene 
appeared.&nbsp; The room was larger than the last one, and filthier.&nbsp; 
The thin outside walls were patched with pieces of pasteboard, the floor 
was covered with dirt, and what straggling pieces of furniture they had 
were lying about as if they had been shaken up by an earthquake.&nbsp; 
There was a miserable fire, and the storm outside howled and rattled away 
at the old roof, threatening to carry it off in every succeeding 
gust.&nbsp; The tenants were a man, his wife, a boy, and a girl.&nbsp; They
had sold their table to pay their rent, and their wretched meal of bones 
and crusts was set on an old packing box which was drawn close up to the 
stove.&nbsp; When the visitors entered the man and woman were standing, 
leaning over the stove.&nbsp; The girl, aged about ten years, and a very 
bright looking child, having just been off on some errand, had got both 
feet wet, and now had her stockings off, holding them close to the coals to
dry them.&nbsp; The boy seemed to be overgrown for his age, and half 
idiotic.&nbsp; He sat at one corner of the stove, his back to the visitors,
and his legs stretched out under the hearth.&nbsp; His big coat collar was 
turned up around his neck, and his chin sunk down, so that his face could 
not be seen.&nbsp; His long, straight hair covered his ears and the sides 
of his face.&nbsp; He did not look up until he was directly questioned by 
Mr. Shultz, and then he simply raised his chin far enough to grunt.&nbsp; 
The girl, when spoken to, looked up slyly and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man, on being asked if he was unable to work, said he would 
be glad to work if he could get anything to do.&nbsp; He was a painter, and
belonged to a painters&rsquo; protective union.&nbsp; But there were so 
many out of employment, that it was useless trying to get any help.&nbsp; 
He pointed to an old basket filled with coke, and said he had just sold 
their last chair to buy it.&nbsp; He had worked eighteen years at the 
Metropolitan Hotel, but got out of work, and has been out ever since.&nbsp;
Mr. Shultz offered to take the little girl into the House of Industry, and 
give her <!-- page 405--><a name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
405</span>board, clothes, and education.&nbsp; He asked the father if he 
would let her go, saying the place was only a few steps from them, and they
could see her often.&nbsp; The man replied that he did not like a 
separation from his child.&nbsp; The missionary assured him that it would 
be no separation, and then asked the mother the same question.&nbsp; She 
stood speechless for several moments, as if thinking over the matter, and 
when the missionary, after using his best arguments, again asked her 
whether she would allow him to take care of her child, she simply replied, 
&lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; She said they would all hang together as long as 
they could, and, if necessary, all would starve together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This family had evidently seen better times.&nbsp; The man had an
honest face, and talked as if he had once been able to earn a respectable 
living.&nbsp; The woman had some features that would be called noble if 
they were worn in connection with costlier apparel.&nbsp; The girl was 
unmistakably smart, and the only thing to mar their appearance as a family,
so far as personal looks were concerned, was the thick-lipped, slovenly 
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; THE CELLARS.</h3>
<p>If the people of whom I have written are sufferers, they at least exist 
upon the surface of the earth.&nbsp; But what shall we say of those who 
pass their lives in the cellars of the wretched buildings I have 
described?</p>
<p>A few of these cellars are dry, but all are dirty.&nbsp; Some are 
occupied as dwelling-places, and some are divided into a sort of store or 
groggery and living and sleeping rooms.&nbsp; Others still are kept as 
lodging-houses, where the poorest of the poor find shelter for the 
night.</p>
<p>In writing of these cellars, I wish it to be understood that I do not 
refer to the rooms partly above and partly below the level of the 
side-walk, with some chance of ventilation, and known to the Health 
Officers as &ldquo;basements,&rdquo; but to the cellars pure and simple, 
all of which are sunk below the level of the street, <!-- page 406--><a 
name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 406</span>and all of which are 
infinitely wretched.&nbsp; There were in April, 1869, about 12,000 of these
cellars known to the Board of Health, and containing from 96,000 to 100,000
persons.&nbsp; With the exception of 211, all of these were such as were 
utterly forbidden, under the health ordinances of the city, to be used or 
rented as tenements.&nbsp; The Board of Health have frequently considered 
the advisability of removing this population, and have been prevented only 
by the magnitude of the task, and the certainty of rendering this large 
number of persons homeless for a time at least.</p>
<p>The larger portion of these cellars have but one entrance, and that 
furnishes the only means of ventilation.&nbsp; They have no outlet to the 
rear, and frequently the filth of the streets comes washing down the walls 
into the room within.&nbsp; In the brightest day they are dark and 
gloomy.&nbsp; The air is always foul.&nbsp; The drains of the houses above 
pass within a few feet of the floor, and as they are generally in bad 
condition the filth frequently comes oozing up and poisons the air with its
foul odors.&nbsp; In some cases there has been found a direct opening from 
the drain into the cellar, affording a free passage for all the sewer gas 
into the room.&nbsp; The Board of Health do all they can to remedy this, 
but the owners and occupants of the cellars are hard to manage, and throw 
every obstacle in the way of the execution of the health ordinances.</p>
<p>The rents paid for these wretched abodes are exorbitant.&nbsp; Dr. 
Harris, the Superintendent of the Board of Health, states that as much as 
twenty dollars per month is often demanded of the occupants by the 
owners.&nbsp; Half of that sum would secure a clean and decent room in some
of the up-town tenements.&nbsp; The poor creatures, in sheer despair, make 
no effort to better their condition, and live on here in misery, and often 
in vice, until death comes to their relief.</p>

<img alt="A FIVE POINTS LODGING CELLAR." src="images/p407.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Many of the cellars are used as lodging-houses.&nbsp; These are known to
the police as &ldquo;Bed Houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; In company with Captain 
Allaire and Detective Finn, the writer once made a tour of inspection 
through these establishments.&nbsp; One of them shall serve as a 
specimen.&nbsp; Descending through a rickety <!-- page 408--><a 
name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 408</span>door-way, we passed 
into a room about sixteen feet square and eight feet high.&nbsp; At one end
was a stove in which a fire burned feebly, and close by a small kerosene 
lamp on a table dimly lighted the room.&nbsp; An old hag, who had lost the 
greater part of her nose, and whose face was half hidden by the huge frill 
of the cap she wore, sat rocking herself in a rickety chair by the 
table.&nbsp; The room was more than half in the shadow, and the air was so 
dense and foul that I could scarcely breathe.&nbsp; By the dim light I 
could see that a number of filthy straw mattresses were ranged on the floor
along the wall.&nbsp; Above these were wooden bunks, like those of a 
barracks, filled with dirty beds and screened by curtains.&nbsp; The room 
was capable of accommodating at least twenty persons, and I was told that 
the hag in the chair, who was the proprietress, was &ldquo;a good hand at 
packing her lodgers well together.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was early, but several 
of the beds were occupied.&nbsp; The curtains were drawn in some cases, and
we could not see the occupants.&nbsp; In one, however, was a child, but 
little more than a baby, as plump and ruddy, and as fair-skinned and pretty
as though it had been the child of a lady of wealth.&nbsp; The little one 
was sleeping soundly, and, by a common instinct, we gathered about its bed,
and watched it in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too pretty a child for such a place,&rdquo; said one of the
party.</p>
<p>I glanced at Detective Finn.&nbsp; His face wore a troubled 
expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man becomes hardened to the sights I see,&rdquo; he said in 
answer to my glance, &ldquo;but I can scarcely keep the tears from my eyes 
when I see a child like this in such a place; for, you see, I know what a 
life it is growing up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wretched place Mr. Finn told us was one of the best of all the bed 
houses.&nbsp; He proved his assertion by conducting us to one out of which 
we beat a hasty retreat.&nbsp; The night air never seemed so pure to me as 
it did as I came out of the vile den into the clear starlight.&nbsp; I 
could scarcely breathe in the fearful hole we had just been in, and yet it 
was rapidly filling up with people who were to pass the night there.&nbsp; 
There were men, <!-- page 409--><a name="page409"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 409</span>women and children, but they were all huddled 
together in one room.&nbsp; There was no such thing as privacy.&nbsp; Some 
of the lodgers were simply unfortunate, some were vagrants, and others were
criminals.</p>
<p>I do not believe that all the sanitary measures in the world could ever 
make these places clean or healthy.&nbsp; The atmosphere is always too foul
and dense to be breathed by any but lungs accustomed to it.&nbsp; When the 
cellars are crowded with lodgers, and the heat of the stove adds to the 
poison, it must be appalling.&nbsp; The poor wretches who seek shelter here
are more than half stupefied by it, and pass the night in this condition 
instead of in a healthful sleep.&nbsp; They pay from ten to twenty-five 
cents for their lodgings, and if they desire a supper or breakfast, are 
given a cup of coffee and a piece of bread, or a bowl of soup for a similar
sum.</p>
<p>As a matter of course only vagrants and those who have gone down into 
the depths of poverty come here.&nbsp; They must choose between the cellars
and the streets, and the beds offered them here are warmer and softer than 
the stones of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we seen the worst?&rdquo; I asked Mr. Finn, as we came out 
of the last place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;there are worse places yet.&nbsp; 
But I&rsquo;ll not take you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader will readily credit this assertion, after reading the 
following account of a visit of the Health Officers to one of a number of 
similar cellars in Washington Street, on the west side of the city:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place next visited was No. 27 Washington street.&nbsp; This 
building is also owned by &lsquo;Butcher Burke,&rsquo; and is one of the 
most filthy and horrible places in the city.&nbsp; We passed under an old 
tumble-down doorway that seemed to have no earthly excuse for standing 
there, and into a dismal, dark entry, with a zig-zag wall covered with a 
leprous slime, our conductor crying out all the time: &lsquo;Steady, 
gentlemen, steady, keep to your left; place is full of holes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently we emerged into a yard with a detestable pavement of 
broken bricks and mud, with high, towering houses <!-- page 410--><a 
name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 410</span>surmounting it all 
around, and a number of broken outhouses and privies covering a large 
portion of the ground surface of the yard.&nbsp; Turning around, we could 
see the back of the tenement house from whose entry we had just emerged, 
with its numberless and wretched windows, shutting out the sky, or the fog,
which was the only thing visible above us, and a cloud of clothes-lines 
stretched hither and thither, like a spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were eight privies in the yard, and we entered them.&nbsp; 
The night soil was within a <i>foot and a half</i> of the seats, and the 
odor was terrible.&nbsp; From these privies a drain passed under the 
surface of the muddy, sloppy yard, to the margin of the building, where a 
descent of perhaps four feet was obtained, at the bottom of which the 
basement floor was level with the windows, giving a sickly light, but no 
air or ventilation whatever, to the inhabitants of the cellar.&nbsp; But 
the worst is yet to be told.&nbsp; The drain from the privies connecting 
with the sewer in the street had a <i>man-hole</i>, which was open, at the 
place where the yard was broken for a descent into this infernal 
cellar.&nbsp; This man-hole was about four feet wide and three feet deep, 
forming a small table for a cataract of night soil and other fecal matter, 
which poured over this artificial table in a miniature and loathsome 
Niagara and into a cesspool at the bottom, and from thence was conducted 
under the rotten boards of the cellar through a brick drain, a few inches 
below the board flooring, to the main sewer in the street.&nbsp; The bottom
of the windows in this house are on a dead level with this horrid cesspool,
so that a man sitting on a chair at the window would not have only the 
odor, but also the view of this loathsome matter circulating at his feet in
the pool below.&nbsp; We entered the back cellar after knocking at the door
a few minutes, and a man, poverty-stricken and wretched in appearance, of 
the laboring class, came with a candle to let us in.&nbsp; The room was in 
a filthy condition, ten by twenty-two and a half feet, with a ceiling of 
six feet three inches elevation from the floor.&nbsp; A woman, wretched and
woe-begone as the man, rose suddenly from a dirty bed at the back of the 
room, and bade us welcome civilly enough, in her night clothing, which was 
scanty.</p>
<p><!-- page 411--><a name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
411</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;And are yees the Boord of Helth, sure.&nbsp; Well 
it isn&rsquo;t much we have to show thin, but yees can see it all without 
any charge at all, at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How much rent do you pay here?&rsquo; asked the writer of 
the man with the candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it rint ye mane?&nbsp; Nyah, its $6 a munth, shure, and
glad to get it, and if we don&rsquo;t pay it, it&rsquo;s the little time 
we&rsquo;ll get from Burke, but out on the street wid us, like pigs, and 
the divil resave the bit of sattysfaction we&rsquo;ll get from him than ye 
would from the Lord Palmershtown, Nyah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How do you live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shure, I put in coal now and thin, whin I can get it to 
put, and that&rsquo;s not often, God knows, alanna!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How much do you earn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it earn d&rsquo;ye say?&nbsp; Sometimes fifty cents a 
day, sometimes two dollars a week; and thin it&rsquo;s good times wid 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Woman of the House.&mdash;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him, man, 
what he&rsquo;s saying.&nbsp; Shure he niver earns two dollars a week at 
all.&nbsp; That id be a good week faix for me.&nbsp; Two dollars 
indade!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you any children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We have one dauther, a girl&mdash;a fine, big 
girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How old is she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I suppose she&rsquo;s twenty-two next 
Mikilmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman.&mdash;&lsquo;Indade she&rsquo;s not, shure.&nbsp; 
She&rsquo;s only a slip of a gerrul, fifteen or sixteen years of age, 
goin&rsquo; on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the parents were arguing the age of their daughter, who, it
seems, worked as a servant girl in some private residence, and only slept 
here when out of employment, the Health Officer was testing the condition 
of the walls by poking his umbrella at the base under the window and 
directly over the cess-pool.&nbsp; The point of the umbrella, which was 
tipped with a thin sheet of brass, made ready entrance into the walls, 
which were so soft and damp that the point of the umbrella when drawn out 
left each time a deep circular mark behind, as if it had been drawn from a 
rotten or decomposed cheese in summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take up a board from the floor,&rsquo; said the Health 
Officer.&nbsp; The man, who informed us that his name was William <!-- page
412--><a name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 412</span>McNamara, 
&lsquo;from Innis, in the County Clare, siventeen miles beyand 
Limerick,&rsquo; readily complied, and taking an axe dug up a board without
much trouble, as the boards were decayed, and right underneath we found the
top of the brick drain, in a bad state of repair, the fecal matter oozing 
up with a rank stench.&nbsp; Every one stooped down to look at this proof 
of sanitary disregard, and while this entire party were on their knees, 
looking at the broken drain, two large rats ran across the floor, and 
nestling in a rather familiar manner between the legs of Mr. McNamara for 
an instant, frisked out of the dreary, dirty room into the luxurious 
cesspool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The physician asked, &lsquo;Are those rats?&rsquo; of Mr. 
McNamara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Rats is it? endade they were.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing out
of the way here to see thim.&nbsp; Shure some of thim are as big as 
cats.&nbsp; And why wouldn&rsquo;t they&mdash;they have no wurrok or 
nothing else to do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; THE MISSIONS.</h3>
<p>There are now three thriving and much-needed Missions in the district, 
to which I have applied the general name of the Five Points.&nbsp; These 
are the <i>Five Points Mission</i>, the <i>Five Points House of 
Industry</i>, and the <i>Howard Mission</i>, <i>or Home for Little 
Wanderers</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Five Points Mission</i> is the oldest.&nbsp; It is conducted by 
the &ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; Home Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal
Church,&rdquo; and as has been stated, occupies the site of the &ldquo;Old 
Brewery.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have already described the &ldquo;Old 
Brewery&rdquo; as it existed twenty years ago.&nbsp; Few decent people ever
ventured near it at that time, and even the missionaries felt that they 
were incurring a risk in venturing into it.</p>
<p>A number of Christian women of position and means, who knew the locality
only by reputation, determined, with a courage peculiar to their sex, to 
break up this den, and make it a stronghold of religion and virtue.&nbsp; 
Their plan was regarded by the public as chimerical, but they persevered in
its execution, <!-- page 413--><a name="page413"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 413</span>trusting in the help of Him in whose cause 
they were laboring.&nbsp; A school was opened in Park street, immediately 
facing the &ldquo;Old Brewery,&rdquo; and was placed in charge of the Rev. 
L. M. Pease, of the Methodist Church.&nbsp; This school at once gathered in
the ragged and dirty children of the neighborhood, and at first it seemed 
impossible to do anything with them.&nbsp; Patience and energy triumphed at
last.&nbsp; The school became a success, and the ladies who had projected 
it resolved to enlarge it.&nbsp; In 1852 the &ldquo;Old Brewery&rdquo; 
building was purchased and pulled down, and in June, 1853, the present 
commodious and handsome Mission building was opened.&nbsp; Since then 
constant success has crowned the efforts of the Ladies&rsquo; 
Society.&nbsp; Their property is now valued at $100,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p413.jpg">
<img alt="THE LADIES&rsquo; FIVE POINTS MISSION." src="images/p413.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Mission is at present in charge of the Rev. James N. Shaffer.&nbsp; 
It receives a small appropriation from the State for the support of its 
day-school, but is mainly dependent upon <!-- page 414--><a 
name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 414</span>voluntary 
contributions for its support.&nbsp; Food, clothing, money, in short, 
everything that can be useful in the establishment, are given it.&nbsp; 
Donations come to it from all parts of the country, for the Mission is 
widely known, and thousands of Christian people give it their 
assistance.&nbsp; The railroad and express companies forward, without 
charge, all packages designed for it.</p>
<p>Children are the chief care of the Mission.&nbsp; Those in charge of it 
believe that first impressions are the strongest and most lasting.&nbsp; 
They take young children away from the haunts of vice and crime, and clothe
and care for them.&nbsp; They are regularly and carefully instructed in the
rudiments of an English education, and are trained to serve the Lord.&nbsp;
At a proper age they are provided with homes, or with respectable 
employment, and are placed in a way to become useful Christian men and 
women.&nbsp; Year after year the work goes on.&nbsp; Children are taken in 
every day, if there is room for them, and are trained in virtue and 
intelligence, and every year the &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; as its inmates love to
call it, sends out a band of brave, bright, useful young people into the 
world.&nbsp; But for its blessed aid they would have been so many more 
vagrants and criminals.</p>
<p>The school averages about 450 pupils.&nbsp; In the twenty years of the 
career of the Mission thousands have been educated by it.&nbsp; As I passed
through the various class-rooms I found children of all ages.&nbsp; In the 
infant-class were little ones who were simply kept warm and amused.&nbsp; 
The amusement was instructive, as well, as they were taught to recognize 
various objects by the young lady in charge of them.&nbsp; They all bore 
evidences of the greatest poverty, but they were unquestionably happy and 
contented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you find harshness necessary?&rdquo; I asked of the lady 
principal, who was my guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;We rely upon 
kindness.&nbsp; If they do not wish to stay with us, we let them go away in
peace.&nbsp; They are mostly good children,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and 
they really love the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little curly-headed girl came up to her as she was speaking:</p>
<p><!-- page 415--><a name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
415</span>&ldquo;What does Louisa want, now?&rdquo; she asked, encouraging 
the child with a kind smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mrs. Van Aiken,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;Nelly 
Jackson wants another cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nelly Jackson was one of the tiniest and plumpest of the infant class I 
had just inspected, and I had found her with a cake in hand at the time of 
my visit.&nbsp; Mrs. Van Aiken hesitated a moment, and then gave the 
desired permission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cakes,&rdquo; she added, turning to me, &ldquo;constitute one of 
our rewards of merit for the little ones.&nbsp; When they are very good we 
give them doll-babies at Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Says the Secretary in her last Report of the work of the Mission: 
&ldquo;These children have quick perceptions and warm hearts, and they are 
not unworthy of the confidence placed in them by their teachers.&nbsp; All 
their happy moments come to them through the Mission School, and kind 
hearts and willing hands occasionally prepare for them a little festival or
excursion, enjoyed with a zest unknown to more prosperous children. . . . 
.&nbsp; An excursion to Central Park was arranged for them one summer 
afternoon.&nbsp; The sight of the animals, the run over the soft green 
grass, so grateful to eye and touch, the sail on the lake, their sweet 
songs keeping time with the stroke of the oar&mdash;all this was a bit of 
fairy land to a childhood of so few pleasures.&nbsp; Then the evening of 
the Fourth of July spent on the roof of the Mission House, enjoying the 
display of fireworks, and singing patriotic songs.&nbsp; One kind friend 
makes a winter evening marvellous to childish eyes by the varied scenes, 
historic, scriptural, poetic, of the magic lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the Mission did no more than give these little ones a warm shelter 
during the day, and provide for them such pleasures as cakes, doll-babies, 
excursions, and magic lanterns, it would still be doing a noble work, for 
these children are dwellers in the Five Points, a locality where pleasure 
is almost unknown.&nbsp; The Mission does more, however, it educates the 
children; it provides them with the clothes they wear, and gives each child
a lunch at midday.&nbsp; It also gives clothing, bedding and food to the 
parents of the children where they need it.&nbsp; It is <!-- page 416--><a 
name="page416"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 416</span>provided with a 
tasteful chapel, in which religious services are held on Sunday and during 
the week.&nbsp; The Sunday-school is large, and provides religious 
instruction for the attendants.&nbsp; A &ldquo;Free Library and 
Reading-room&rdquo; has been opened in the basement, for the use of all who
will avail themselves of it.&nbsp; It is open every night, and it is well 
patronized by the adult population of the vicinity.&nbsp; The homeless and 
friendless, who are simply unfortunate, are sheltered, as far as the 
accommodations will permit, and are provided with homes and 
employment.&nbsp; The work of the Mission, apart from its schools, for the 
year ending May 1st, 1871, is thus summed up by the Secretary: &ldquo;The 
following statistics do not include coal nor medicine, which are very 
considerable items: 5197 pieces of clothing, including pairs of shoes and 
bed-quilts, have been distributed from the wardrobes, and 1293 through the 
office, making a total of 6490; 122,113 rations of food have been given to 
the needy; 4 infants have been adopted; 66 children have been provided with
homes; and 119 adults have been sent to places of employment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Treasurer states that during the same period $3004 were given away 
in &ldquo;direct charities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Five Points House of Industry</i> is situated on Worth street, 
diagonally opposite the <i>Home Mission</i>.&nbsp; It consists of two large
brick edifices, covering an area about 100 feet square.&nbsp; This Mission 
was begun by the Rev. L. M. Pease, the same gentleman who was in charge of 
the Home Mission at the time of the purchase of the &ldquo;Old 
Brewery.&rdquo;&nbsp; He conceived a different plan for the management of 
the Home Mission from that determined upon by the ladies, and finding 
cooperation impossible, resigned his position, and began his labors afresh,
according to his own plan, and trusting entirely to the generosity of the 
public for his support.&nbsp; He was ably assisted by his good wife in 
carrying out his plan.&nbsp; He began with one room, and in 1853 was able 
to hire five houses, which he filled with the occupants of the wretched 
hovels in the vicinity.&nbsp; He procured work for them, such as 
needle-work, basket-making, baking, straw-work, shoe-making, etc.&nbsp; He 
made himself personally <!-- page 417--><a name="page417"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 417</span>responsible to the persons giving the work for
its safe return.&nbsp; The expenses of the Mission were then, as now, paid 
from the profits of this work, and the donations of persons interested in 
the scheme.&nbsp; Five hundred persons were thus supported.&nbsp; Schools 
were opened, children were taught, clothed and fed, and religious services 
were regularly conducted.</p>
<p>In 1854, the health of Mr. Pease began to fail under his herculean 
labors.&nbsp; He had carried his enterprise to a successful issue, 
however.&nbsp; He had done good to thousands, and had won friends for the 
institution, who were resolved, and possessed of the means, to carry it 
on.&nbsp; A Society was incorporated for the conduct of the Mission, and, 
in 1856, the larger of the present buildings was erected.&nbsp; In 1869, 
the edifice was increased to its present size.&nbsp; Heavy donations were 
made to the institution by Mr. Sickles, who gave $20,000, and Mr. Chauncy 
Rose, who gave $10,000, and it was constantly in receipt of smaller sums, 
which made up an aggregate sufficient to provide for its wants.&nbsp; Its 
progress has been onward and upward, and it is a noble monument to the 
energy and Christian charity of Mr. Pease, its founder.</p>
<p>The main work of the Mission is with the children, but it also looks 
after the adults of the wretched quarter in which it is located.&nbsp; 
There are about two hundred children residing in the building.&nbsp; These 
have been taken from the cellars and garrets of the Five Points.&nbsp; Two 
hundred more, children of the very poor, are in attendance upon the 
schools.&nbsp; All are clothed and fed here.&nbsp; Besides being educated, 
they are taught useful trades.&nbsp; The House is supported partly by 
voluntary contributions and partly by the labor of its inmates.</p>
<p>Besides the children, there are always about forty destitute women, who 
would otherwise be homeless, residing in the building.&nbsp; The annual 
number thus sheltered is about six hundred.&nbsp; They are provided with 
situations as servants as rapidly as possible.&nbsp; Since its opening, 
sixteen years ago, the House has sheltered and provided for 20,000 
persons.&nbsp; The number of lodgings furnished yearly is about 90,000, and
the daily number of meals averages 1000.&nbsp; Since 1856, 4,135,218 meals 
have <!-- page 418--><a name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
418</span>been given to the poor.&nbsp; No one is ever turned away hungry, 
and sometimes as many as 150 persons, men and women, driven to the doors of
the House by hunger, may be seen seated at its table at the dinner 
hour.</p>
<p><i>The Howard Mission and Home for Little Wanderers</i> is situated in 
the heart of the Fourth Ward, in one of the most wretched quarters of the 
city.&nbsp; Here the inhabitants are packed into their dirty dwellings at 
the rate of 290,000 persons to the square mile.&nbsp; The dirt and the 
wretchedness of this part of the city are terrible to behold, the 
sufferings of the people are very great, and the mortality is heavy.&nbsp; 
Sailors&rsquo; lodging houses of the lowest character, dance houses, rum 
shops, and thieves&rsquo; cribs are numerous, and the moral condition of 
the Ward is worse than the sanitary.</p>
<p>In May, 1861, the Rev. W. C. Van Meter organized a Mission in the very 
heart of this locality, to which he gave the name of the <i>Howard Mission 
and Home for Little Wanderers</i>.&nbsp; For three years it was maintained 
by his individual exertions, but, in 1864, Mr. Van Meter having secured for
it wealthy and powerful friends, it was regularly incorporated, and placed 
under the control of a Board of Managers, Mr. Van Meter still continuing to
act as Superintendent.&nbsp; Since then, comfortable and tasteful brick 
buildings have been erected for the Mission, and it is succeeding now 
beyond the first hopes of its founder.&nbsp; Our engraving shows the New 
Bowery front as it will appear when completed.</p>
<p>The Mission is located in the New Bowery, just below its junction with 
Chatham Square.&nbsp; It extends back to Roosevelt street, upon which 
thoroughfare there is an entrance.&nbsp; The erection of the buildings on 
the New Bowery will about double the size of the Mission, and 
proportionately increase its capacity for doing good.&nbsp; It is entirely 
dependent upon voluntary contributions for its support.</p>

<img alt="THE HOWARD MISSION (AS IT WILL APPEAR WHEN COMPLETED)."

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our object,&rdquo; says Mr. Van Meter, &ldquo;is to do all the 
good we can to the souls and bodies of all whom we can reach.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
It may be added, that the prime object of the Mission is to care for 
neglected and abused children, whether orphans or not, and <!-- page 
420--><a name="page420"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 420</span>also for the
children of honest and struggling poverty.&nbsp; It further undertakes to 
aid and comfort the sick, to furnish food, shelter, and clothing to the 
destitute, to procure work for the unemployed, and to impart intellectual, 
moral, and religious instruction to all who are willing to receive it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our field,&rdquo; says Mr. Van Meter, &ldquo;is the very 
concentration of all evil and the headquarters of the most desperate and 
degraded representatives of many nations.&nbsp; It swarms with poor little 
helpless victims, who are born in sin and shame, nursed in misery, want, 
and woe, and carefully trained to all manner of degradation, vice, and 
crime.&nbsp; The <i>packing</i> of these poor creatures is 
incredible.&nbsp; In this ward there are less than two dwelling houses for 
each low rum hole, gambling house, and den of infamy.&nbsp; Near us, on a 
small lot, but 150 by 240 feet, are twenty tenant houses, 111 families, 5 
stables, a soap and candle factory, and a tan yard.&nbsp; On four blocks, 
close to the Mission, are 517 children, 318 Roman Catholic and 10 
Protestant families, 35 rum holes, and 18 brothels.&nbsp; In No. 14 Baxter 
street, but three or four blocks from us, are 92 families, consisting of 92
men, 81 women, 54 boys and 53 girls.&nbsp; Of these, 151 are Italians, 92 
Irish, 28 Chinese, 3 English, 2 Africans, 2 Jews, 1 German, and but 7 
Americans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our work,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is chiefly with the 
children.&nbsp; These are divided into three classes, consisting of, I. 
Those placed under our care to be sent to homes and situations.&nbsp; II. 
Those whom we are not authorized to send to homes, but who need a temporary
shelter until their friends can provide for them or surrender them to 
us.&nbsp; These two classes remain day and night in the Mission.&nbsp; III.
Those who have homes or places in which to sleep.&nbsp; These enjoy the 
benefits of the wardrobe, dining and school rooms, but do not sleep in the 
Mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food, fuel and clothing are given to the poor, after a careful 
inspection of their condition.&nbsp; Mothers leave their small children in 
the day nursery during the day while they go out to work.&nbsp; The sick 
are visited, assisted, and comforted.&nbsp; Work is sought for the 
unemployed.&nbsp; We help the poor to help themselves.</p>
<p><!-- page 421--><a name="page421"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
421</span>&ldquo;The children over whom we can get legal control are placed
in carefully selected Christian families, chiefly in the country, either 
for adoption or as members of the families. . .&nbsp; They receive a good 
common school education, or are trained to some useful business, trade, or 
profession, and are thus fitted for the great duties of mature life.&nbsp; 
We know that our work prevents crime; keeps hundreds of children out of the
streets, keeps boys out of bar-rooms, gambling houses, and prisons, and 
girls out of concert saloons, dance houses, and other avenues that lead 
down to death; and that it makes hundreds of cellar and attic homes more 
cleanly, more healthy, and more happy, and less wretched, wicked, and 
hopeless.&nbsp; We never turn a homeless child from our door.&nbsp; From 
past experience we are warranted in saying that one dollar a week will keep
a well filled plate on our table for any little wanderer, and secure to it 
all the benefits of the Mission.&nbsp; Ten dollars will pay the average 
cost of placing a child in a good home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the ten years of its existence, the Mission has received more 
than 10,000 children into its day and Sunday schools.&nbsp; Hundreds of 
these have been provided with good homes.&nbsp; Thousands of poor women 
have left their little ones here while they were at their daily work, 
knowing that their babies are cared for with kindness and 
intelligence.&nbsp; The famous nurseries of Paris exact a fee of four 
cents, American money, per head for taking care of the children during the 
day, but at the Little Wanderers&rsquo; Home, this service is rendered to 
the mother and child without charge.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of the great work which the Missions are carrying on, the 
wretchedness, the suffering, the vice and the crime of the Five Points are 
appalling.&nbsp; All these establishments need all the assistance and 
encouragement that can possibly be given them.&nbsp; More workers are 
needed, and more means to sustain them.&nbsp; &ldquo;The harvest indeed is 
plenteous, but the laborers are few.&rdquo;</p>

422</span>XXVIII.&nbsp; THE MILITARY.</h2>
<p>The city is very proud of its military organization, and both the 
Municipal and State Governments contribute liberally to its support.&nbsp; 
This organization consists of the First Division of the National Guard of 
the State of New York.&nbsp; The law creating this division was passed in 
1862, when the old volunteer system was entirely reorganized.&nbsp; 
Previous to this, the volunteers had borne their entire expenses, and had 
controlled their affairs in their own way.&nbsp; By the new law important 
changes were introduced.</p>
<p>The division consists of four brigades, and numbers about 13,000 
men.&nbsp; The regiments comprising it are as follows: First, Second, 
Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Eleventh, Twelfth, 
Twenty-second, Thirty-seventh, Fifty-fifth, Sixty-ninth, Seventy-first, 
Seventy-ninth, Ninety-sixth, Washington Grays (cavalry), First Cavalry, 
Second Cavalry, and First Artillery.&nbsp; The United States provides the 
arms and uniforms when required.&nbsp; These, when furnished by the General
Government, are such as are prescribed by law for the Regular Army.&nbsp; 
The best regiments, however, prefer a handsomer dress, and provide their 
own uniforms.&nbsp; The city makes an appropriation of $500 per annum for 
each regiment, for an armory.&nbsp; The other expenses, such as parades, 
music, etc., are borne by the regiment itself.&nbsp; Each regiment has its 
armory, in which are deposited its arms and valuable property.&nbsp; An 
armorer is in charge of the building, and it is his duty to keep the guns 
in good order.&nbsp; A reading-room and library are attached to some of the
armories, and are used as places of social reunion for the members of the 
command.&nbsp; Drills are held at stated times, and a rigid discipline is 
maintained.&nbsp; The men, as a <!-- page 423--><a name="page423"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 423</span>general rule, are proud of their 
organizations, and are enthusiastic in military matters.&nbsp; They are all
well drilled, and will compare favorably with any troops in the world, in 
both appearance and efficiency.&nbsp; Nearly all saw service during the 
late war, and there is not a regiment but treasures some smoke-begrimed, 
bullet-rent flag, as its most precious possession.&nbsp; Out of the 13,000 
men comprising the force, 9000 were in the field in active service, at one 
time during the war, and the division gave the country 3780 officers for 
the struggle.&nbsp; The total force furnished by the city of New York 
during the war was 100,000 men.&nbsp; Of these 9000 were killed or wounded,
and 37,000 were officers at some period of the war.</p>
<p>The most popular and efficient regiments are the Seventh, Ninth, and 
Twenty-second.&nbsp; The Seventh and Ninth are the best known.&nbsp; The 
latter has the finest band in the city, and one of the best in the 
world.</p>
<p>The parade of the entire division is a sight worth seeing, and always 
brings a crowd upon the streets.&nbsp; Every available place for viewing 
the march is eagerly sought.&nbsp; The shop-keepers along the route of the 
procession find it an easy matter to rent their windows and balconies at 
large prices.&nbsp; Even the housetops are filled with spectators, and the 
sidewalks are &ldquo;jammed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each regiment as it passes is greeted with greater or less applause, 
according to its popularity.&nbsp; The day is a sort of holiday in the 
city, and the parade is one of the sights of the New World, for New York is
the only city in the country which can put so large and splendid a force of
troops in the field in a mere parade.</p>
<p>But the First Division is not a holiday force, and parades and 
receptions are not the only occasions which bring it upon the 
streets.&nbsp; The city of New York contains a population hard to manage, 
and which can be controlled only by a strong, firm hand.&nbsp; The police 
force, about 2000 in number, is utterly inadequate to the repression of an 
uprising of the criminal class of the city, and the scoundrels know 
it.&nbsp; The police have never been lacking in emergencies, but their task
is wonderfully lightened by the knowledge that behind them stand 13,000 
<!-- page 424--><a name="page424"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
424</span>disciplined and well-equipped troops to support them if the task 
of enforcing the law proves too great for them.&nbsp; The roughs of New 
York know that they are no match for such an army as this, and they are 
influenced greatly by this knowledge.&nbsp; The respectable class, the men 
of property, and the heads of families find no little comfort in this 
certainty of protection.&nbsp; They know they can trust to the troops, for 
the members of the National Guard represent the best part of the population
of New York, and are to a man directly interested in preserving the peace 
and prosperity of the city.</p>
<p>The troops are always ready for duty.&nbsp; They are scattered all over 
the city, pursuing various useful callings, but at a certain signal sounded
from the City Hall bell, they will rally at their armories, and in an hour 
there will be a strong body of trained troops ready to enforce the law in 
any emergency.&nbsp; No one can doubt that the summons will be obeyed, for 
the past history of the division proves that even the men who are careless 
about attending parades, etc., are very careful to be at their posts in the
hour of danger.</p>
<p>The employment of this force is not open to the objections that are 
brought against the use of the military in a free country.&nbsp; These men 
are not mercenaries, but are useful and honorable citizens and members of 
society.&nbsp; They have a good record, and the history of the city 
contains several conspicuous instances of their gallantry and 
devotion.&nbsp; In 1837, when the banks suspended specie payments, they 
alone prevented a terrible and destructive riot.&nbsp; In 1849, they 
promptly suppressed the Astor Place Riot, which was brought about by a 
disgraceful attempt on the part of a band of ruffians to mob the English 
actor Macready, who was then playing at the Astor Place Opera House.&nbsp; 
They prevented a serious riot at the time of the creation of the 
Metropolitan Police Force, compelled Mayor Wood and his partisans to yield 
obedience to the laws they had sworn to disregard, and put down the 
disturbances which afterward occurred.&nbsp; In 1863, when the famous Draft
Riots commenced, they were absent from the city, having been sent to meet 
Lee at Gettysburg.&nbsp; They were summoned back by telegraph, and <!-- 
page 425--><a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
425</span>returned in time to take up the battle which had been for two 
days so gallantly fought by the police.&nbsp; They made short work of the 
mob, and soon restored order.&nbsp; In July, 1871, they were called on by 
the City Authorities to protect the Orange Lodges in their right to 
parade.&nbsp; An ignorant, brutal mob declared that the parade should not 
take place because it was offensive to them, and made preparations to stop 
it by force.&nbsp; The Mayor of the city tamely yielded to the threats and 
demands of the mob, and forbade the parade.&nbsp; Fortunately for the 
credit of the city, fortunately for the moral power of the law, the 
Governor of the State revoked the order of the Mayor, and assured the 
Orangemen of full protection in their right to parade.&nbsp; The city, 
which had rung with indignant cries at the cowardly surrender of the Mayor 
to the mob, was now jubilant.&nbsp; The regiments ordered on duty by the 
Governor for the protection of the procession responded with alacrity, and 
came out with full ranks.&nbsp; The mob, still defiant, still thinking 
themselves masters of the situation, made an attack on the procession and 
its military escort.&nbsp; The troops submitted in silence, until some of 
their number were shot down in the ranks.&nbsp; Then wheeling suddenly, 
they poured a fatal volley into the midst of the rioters, who broke and 
fled in dismay.&nbsp; There was no further attempt at violence.&nbsp; The 
lesson was a useful one, and the effect fully worth the valuable lives that
were laid down in the defence of the law.</p>
<h2><!-- page 426--><a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
426</span>XXIX.&nbsp; NASSAU STREET.</h2>
<p>If you will go to the southern extremity of Printing House Square, on 
the east side of the City Hall Park, you will see the opening of a narrow 
street between the offices of the <i>Tribune</i> and <i>Times</i> 
newspapers.&nbsp; This is Nassau street.&nbsp; It runs parallel with 
Broadway, and terminates at Wall street.&nbsp; It is about half a mile in 
length, and is one of the narrowest and most inconvenient streets in the 
city, being less than fifty feet in width.&nbsp; The houses on each side 
are tall and sombre looking, and the street is almost always in the 
shadow.&nbsp; The roadway is hardly wide enough for two vehicles to pass 
abreast, and the sidewalks could never by any possible chance contain a 
crowd.&nbsp; Indeed, the street is seldom thronged, and the people you meet
there seem to be possessed of but one desire&mdash;to get out of it as fast
as possible.&nbsp; A stranger would, at the first glance, unhesitatingly 
pronounce it an inconvenient as well as a disagreeable thoroughfare, and 
yet the truth is that it is one of the most important streets in the city 
in respect of the amount and variety of the traffic carried on within its 
limits.</p>
<p>It would be hard to describe its architecture.&nbsp; Scarcely any two 
houses are built alike.&nbsp; At the lower end, in the vicinity of Wall 
street, iron, marble, and brown stone structures flourish, but above the 
Post-office the buildings are a study.&nbsp; The most of them are old, but 
all show signs of vigorous life, and from cellar to attic they are jammed 
full of busy, scheming, toiling men.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p427.jpg">
<img alt="NASSAU STREET." src="images/p427.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Along the street are some of the best known and most trusted banking 
houses of the city, and millions of dollars are represented in their daily 
transactions.&nbsp; The great Post-office receives <!-- page 427--><a 
name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 427</span>and sends out whole 
tons of matter every twenty-four hours.&nbsp; The bulk of the periodical, 
and a large part of the book-trade are carried on here through the agency 
of the great news companies.&nbsp; Real estate men flourish here.&nbsp; 
Struggling lawyers seem to think this street the road to success, for here 
they cluster by the score.&nbsp; You may buy here diamonds of the purest 
water, and others that had better be kept out of water.&nbsp; The most 
valuable of watches may be obtained here; also the most genuine pinchbeck 
timepieces.&nbsp; If one is a judge of the article he is buying, he may 
frequently purchase to advantage in <!-- page 428--><a 
name="page428"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 428</span>Nassau street, but as
a rule he must examine his purchase closely before paying for it, and be 
sure he receives what he has selected.&nbsp; The variety of the pursuits 
carried on here may be ascertained only by a diligent perusal of the signs 
that line the street.&nbsp; Perhaps in no other thoroughfare is there to be
seen such a multitude of signs.&nbsp; The fronts of the houses are covered 
with them.&nbsp; They appear in nearly every window, and the walls of the 
halls of the buildings, and even the steps themselves are covered with 
them.&nbsp; Every device of the sign maker has been exhausted here, and 
they tell their stories with more or less emphasis, according to the 
ingenuity exercised upon them.&nbsp; They tell you of &ldquo;Counsellors at
Law,&rdquo; Publishers, Artists, Dealers in Foreign and American 
Engravings, Jewellers, Engravers on Wood and Steel, Printers, Stock 
Brokers, Gold Beaters, Restaurant Keepers, Dealers in Cheap Watches, Agents
of Literary Bureaux, Translators of Foreign Languages, Fruit Sellers, 
Boarding House Brokers, Matrimonial Agents, Book Sellers, Dealers in 
Indecent Publications, and a host of others too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Go into one of the numerous buildings, and a surprise awaits you.&nbsp; 
You might spend half a day in exploring it.&nbsp; It rivals the Tower of 
Babel in height, and is alive with little closets called 
&ldquo;offices.&rdquo;&nbsp; How people doing business here are ever found 
by those having dealings with them is a mystery.&nbsp; Many, indeed, come 
here to avoid being found, for Nassau street is the headquarters of those 
who carry on their business by circulars, and under assumed names.&nbsp; It
is a good hiding place, and one in which a culprit might safely defy the 
far-reaching arm of Justice.</p>
<p>Along the street, and mostly in the cellars, cluster the &ldquo;Old Book
Stores&rdquo; of New York, of which I shall have more to say hereafter, and
they add not a little to the singular character of the street.&nbsp; The 
proprietors are generally men who have been here for years, and who know 
the locality well.&nbsp; Many curious tales could they tell of their 
cramped and dingy thoroughfare, tales that in vivid interest and dramatic 
force would set up half a dozen novelists.</p>
<p><!-- page 429--><a name="page429"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
429</span>The Post-office draws all sorts of people into the street, and it
is interesting to watch them as they come and go.&nbsp; But, as has been 
said, no one stays here long; no one thinks of lounging in Nassau 
street.&nbsp; Every one goes at the top of his speed, and bumps and thumps 
are given and taken with a coolness and patience known only to the New 
Yorker.&nbsp; You may even knock a man off his legs, and send him rolling 
into the gutter, and he will smile, pick himself up again, and think no 
more of the matter.&nbsp; On Broadway the same man would not fail to resent
such an assault as an intentional insult.&nbsp; Every one here is full of 
unrest; every one seems pre-occupied with his own affairs, and totally 
oblivious to all that is passing around him.&nbsp; In no part of the great 
city are you so fully impressed with the shortness and value of time.&nbsp;
Even in the eating houses, where the denizens of the street seek their 
noontide meal, you see the same haste that is manifest on the street.&nbsp;
The waiters seem terribly agitated and excited, they fairly fly to do your 
bidding, pushing and bumping each other with a force that often sends their
loads of dishes clattering to the floor.&nbsp; The man at the desk can 
hardly count your change fast enough.&nbsp; The guests bolt their food, 
gulp their liquors, and dart through the green baize doors as if their 
lives depended upon their speed.</p>
<p>So all day long they pour in and out of the marble banks, in and out of 
the great Post-office, in and out of the dingy offices&mdash;the good and 
the bad, the rich and the poor, the honest dealer and the sharper.&nbsp; 
Few know their neighbors here, fewer care for them; and gigantic successes 
and dreary failures find their way into the street, adding year by year to 
its romance and to its mystery.&nbsp; At night the street is dark and 
deserted.&nbsp; Yet away up in some of the lofty buildings, the lights 
shining through the dingy windows tell you that some busy brain is still 
scheming and struggling&mdash;whether honestly or dishonestly, who can 
tell?</p>
<h2><!-- page 430--><a name="page430"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
430</span>XXX.&nbsp; THE METROPOLITAN FIRE DEPARTMENT.</h2>
<p>The history of New York has been marked by a series of terrible fires, 
which have destroyed many lives and swept away millions of dollars worth of
property.&nbsp; In 1741 the first of these conflagrations swept over the 
lower part of the city, consuming many houses, among them the old Dutch 
fort and church.&nbsp; On the 21st of September, 1776, during the 
occupation of the city by the British, 493 houses were burned, and great 
distress entailed in consequence upon the people.&nbsp; On the 9th of 
August, 1778, a third fire destroyed nearly 300 buildings east of Broadway 
and below Pearl street.&nbsp; In May, 1811, a fourth fire broke out in 
Chatham street and consumed nearly 100 houses.&nbsp; In 1828 a fifth fire 
destroyed about a million of dollars worth of property.&nbsp; On the 16th 
of December, 1835, began the sixth and most disastrous of these 
conflagrations.&nbsp; It raged for three days and nights continuously, 
swept over an area of 45 acres, destroyed 648 buildings, and entailed upon 
the citizens a loss of $18,000,000.&nbsp; In the face of this great 
disaster the insurance companies unanimously suspended.&nbsp; On the 19th 
of July, 1845, the seventh and last fire broke out in New street, near Wall
street, and swept in a southerly direction, destroying 345 buildings.&nbsp;
The loss was $5,000,000.</p>
<p>As a matter of course, a city that has suffered so much from fires is in
especial need of the best known means of preventing and suppressing 
them.&nbsp; Since the year 1653 there has been a Fire Department in New 
York, and it would be an interesting task to review its history had we the 
space to do so.&nbsp; In its early days it was considered an honor to be a 
member of a fire company, and some of the best of the old-time citizens 
were to be <!-- page 431--><a name="page431"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
431</span>found in the ranks of the various organizations.&nbsp; The city 
took care to keep the force provided with the most improved machines, and 
every effort was made to render it as efficient as possible.&nbsp; As the 
city increased in wealth and population the character of the firemen 
changed.&nbsp; The respectable men left the organization, and their places 
were filled with men who were drawn into it by the excitement which was to 
be found in such a life.&nbsp; Soon the department passed entirely into the
hands of the Bowery boys and other disreputable characters.&nbsp; The 
engine houses were rallying places for the worst characters of the 
vicinity, who amused themselves in their leisure hours by fighting among 
themselves, or by assaulting respectable passers-by.&nbsp; A fire was the 
dread of the city, not only for the damage the conflagration was sure to 
do, but for the disturbance it brought about on the streets.&nbsp; As soon 
as an alarm was sounded the streets were filled with a yelling, reckless 
crowd, through which the engines and hose-carriages dashed, regardless of 
those who were run over.&nbsp; Pandemonium seemed to have broken loose and 
taken possession of the great thoroughfares.&nbsp; If two rival companies 
met on the streets they would leave the fire to work its will and fight 
their battle then and there.&nbsp; There was scarcely a fire without its 
accompanying riot.&nbsp; The fires themselves were disastrous.&nbsp; Very 
little good was accomplished by the firemen, and the losses were 
tremendous.&nbsp; Adjoining buildings were often broken open and robbed 
under pretence of saving them from the flames.&nbsp; In short, the whole 
department was a nuisance, and thinking men saw that it was a great nursery
of criminals and blackguards.&nbsp; Efforts were made to remedy the evil, 
but without success.&nbsp; The members of the department were volunteers, 
and were particularly impatient of control.&nbsp; Many of the companies 
owned their own engines and other apparatus, and refused to submit to any 
sort of restraint.&nbsp; There was but one way to bring good out of this 
evil, and at length the best men of the city determined upon abolishing the
old system entirely.&nbsp; The demand for a change grew stronger every day,
and at last the Legislature of the State set on foot measures for the 
abolition of the volunteer system and the substitution of a paid force.</p>
<p><!-- page 432--><a name="page432"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
432</span>In March, 1865, the Legislature passed the bill creating the 
Metropolitan Fire Department, and it at once received the Executive 
signature.&nbsp; The friends of the old system resolved to resist the 
attempt to overthrow it.&nbsp; A case involving the constitutionality of 
the bill was brought before the Court of Appeals, which body sustained the 
law.&nbsp; Efforts were made by the newly-appointed Commissioners to get 
the new system at work as soon as possible; but in the meanwhile the 
partizans of the old system endeavored to be revenged by disbanding the old
force and leaving the city without any means of extinguishing fires.&nbsp; 
The danger was great, but it was averted by detailing a force from the 
police to act as firemen in case of necessity.&nbsp; By November, 1865, the
new system was thoroughly organized and fairly at work.&nbsp; Each 
succeeding year has witnessed some fresh improvement, and at present New 
York has the best appointed and most efficient Fire Department in the 
Union.</p>
<p>The force, as at present organized, is under the control of five 
commissioners, appointed by the Mayor of the city.&nbsp; They make rules 
and regulations for the government of the force, exercise a general 
supervision over its affairs, and are responsible to the municipal 
government for their acts.&nbsp; The force consists of a chief engineer, an
assistant engineer, ten district engineers, and 587 officers and men.&nbsp;
Each company consists of twelve persons, viz.: a foreman, assistant 
foreman, engineer of steamer, a stoker, a driver, and seven firemen.&nbsp; 
Each company is provided with a house, with engine room, stables, quarters 
for the men, and rooms for study, drill, etc.&nbsp; The basement contains a
furnace, by means of which the building is warmed and the water in the 
engine kept hot.&nbsp; Everything is kept in perfect order.&nbsp; The 
houses are clean and neat, and the engines and hose-carriages shine like 
gold and silver.</p>
<p>The men are all paid by the city.&nbsp; The firemen receive $1000 
dollars per annum, and the officers a higher sum, according to their duties
and responsibilities.&nbsp; The men undergo a rigid physical examination, 
and are required to present proofs of their good moral character before 
they are admitted to the force.&nbsp; The object is to have none but men 
perfectly sound and free <!-- page 433--><a name="page433"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 433</span>from habits tending to impair their usefulness
in the force.&nbsp; They are generally fine specimens of manhood, are 
noticeably neat in their dress and habits, and are just the opposite of the
old-time volunteer firemen.&nbsp; Furthermore, they may be relied upon in 
any emergency.</p>
<p>There are thirty-seven steam-engines in the department.&nbsp; They are 
of the second class or size, and perfect in all their appointments.&nbsp; 
They were built by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, of Manchester, New 
Hampshire, and cost $4000 a-piece.&nbsp; There is also a powerful floating 
engine located on a steamboat, and used for extinguishing fires on the 
piers or on vessels in the harbor.&nbsp; It is kept near the Battery, so as
to be convenient to points in either river.&nbsp; There are four hand 
engines, located in the upper part of the island, and twelve hook and 
ladder companies in the department.&nbsp; Several engines are kept in 
reserve, and are not counted in the active force.</p>
<p>The horses of the department are 156 in number.&nbsp; They are large and
powerful animals, and are kept with the greatest care.&nbsp; They are 
groomed every day, and are fed punctually at six o&rsquo;clock morning and 
evening.&nbsp; If not used on duty, they are exercised every day by being 
led to and fro in the streets adjoining the engine-house.&nbsp; They are 
thoroughly trained, and will stand with perfect steadiness under the most 
exciting circumstances.&nbsp; They know the sound of the alarm-bell as well
as their driver, and the moment it strikes they exhibit an impatience to be
off which is remarkable.&nbsp; They are kept harnessed constantly, and it 
takes but a few seconds to attach them to the engines.</p>
<p>The men are not allowed to have any other employment.&nbsp; The 
department claims their whole duty.&nbsp; A certain number are required to 
be always at the engine-house.&nbsp; In case of an alarm being sounded 
during the absence of a fireman from the engine-house he runs directly to 
the fire, where he is sure to find his company.&nbsp; A watch is always 
kept in the engine-room day and night.&nbsp; After ten at night the men are
allowed to go to bed, but must so arrange matters beforehand that they 
shall lose no time in dressing.&nbsp; The horses stand <!-- page 434--><a 
name="page434"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 434</span>harnessed in their 
stalls, the boiler is filled with hot water, and the furnaces are supplied 
with wood which burns at the touch of a match.&nbsp; It requires but 
fifteen seconds in the day and but one minute at night to be ready for 
action and on the way to the fire.</p>
<p>Scattered through the city are lofty towers, from which men keep a 
constant watch for fires.&nbsp; They are thoroughly acquainted with the 
various localities of New York, and can tell at a glance the exact 
neighborhood of the fire.&nbsp; From their lofty elevation they see the 
first cloud of smoke if it be day, or the first red glare if at night, and 
the next instant the alarm is sent over the city on the wings of 
electricity.</p>
<p>All signals and messages connected with the Fire Department are 
transmitted by telegraph, and for this purpose there is a distinct line 
through the city for the use of the department.&nbsp; By means of this line
the various engine-houses are brought into communication with each other 
and with the central station and police headquarters.&nbsp; As the 
station-houses alone, however, would not suffice for the prompt 
communication of alarms, signal-boxes are scattered through the city at the
most convenient points.&nbsp; These boxes are so situated that they may be 
reached from any point in a few minutes.&nbsp; They are several hundred in 
number, and are being multiplied as rapidly as possible.&nbsp; The 
engraving accompanying this chapter shows the appearance and mechanism of 
the signal box.</p>
<p>The box is attached to the telegraph pole, and is about twenty-four 
inches high, by twelve inches wide, and five inches deep.&nbsp; Every 
officer and member of the Fire Department, every officer and member of the 
Police Force, and every officer of the Fire Insurance Patrol is furnished 
with a key which will open all the boxes.&nbsp; A key is also deposited 
with the occupant of a building near the box, and a notice showing the 
location of this key is always placed in a glass case at the top of the 
box.&nbsp; Key-holders are cautioned not to open the box except in case of 
fire; not to give an alarm unless sure of a fire; not to give an alarm for 
a fire seen at a distance; not to pull down the hook more than once in 
giving an alarm; to be sure, after giving an alarm, <!-- page 346--><a 
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>that the door of the 
box is securely fastened; and not to let the key go out of their possession
except when demanded by proper authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="FIRE ALARM SIGNAL-BOX." src="images/p435.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The engraving referred to will show the manner of giving an alarm.&nbsp;
There are two doors to each box, an outer and an inner door, lettered 
respectively F and G in the engraving.&nbsp; The door G is to be kept 
closed unless it becomes necessary to repeat the alarm.&nbsp; The outer 
door, F, is opened, and the catch A is drawn down firmly.&nbsp; This winds 
up a spring, by means of the lever B, which sets in motion the wheel C, and
strikes the number of the box on the gong D and on the instrument at the 
Fire Department headquarters.&nbsp; Should it be necessary to give a second
or third alarm, the door G is opened and the Morse key E is struck ten 
times.</p>
<p>In this way all alarms are sent, first to the central office, and thence
to the various engine-houses.&nbsp; The alarm from the central office is 
struck on a large gong placed in a conspicuous part of the engine-room of 
every engine or hook and ladder company.&nbsp; The locality, and often the 
precise site of the fire can be ascertained by means of these 
signals.&nbsp; For instance, the bell strikes 157 thus: <i>one</i>&mdash;a 
pause&mdash;<i>five</i>&mdash;another pause&mdash;<i>seven</i>.&nbsp; The 
indicator will show that this alarm-box is at the corner of the Bowery and 
Grand street.&nbsp; The fire is either at this point or within its 
immediate neighborhood.&nbsp; The signals are repeated on all the bells in 
the fire-towers of the city, and the citizens, by consulting their printed 
indicators, can inform themselves of the location of the fire.&nbsp; On an 
alarm of fire about one-sixth of the whole force goes to the place of 
danger.&nbsp; If the alarm be repeated the number is increased by another 
sixth, and so on until the necessary force is obtained.&nbsp; Each company 
is restricted to certain portions of the city, so that there is no 
confusion in sending out the proper force.</p>
<p>As soon as the sharp strokes of the gong give the signal of danger, and 
point out the locality, every man springs to his post.&nbsp; The horses are
attached in a few seconds, the fire is lighted in the furnace, and the 
steamer and hose carriage start for the scene of action.&nbsp; The foreman 
runs on foot, ahead of his <!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>steamer, to clear the way, and the driver may 
keep up with him, but is not allowed to pass him.&nbsp; Only the engineer, 
his assistant, and the stoker are allowed to ride on the engine.&nbsp; The 
rest of the company go on foot.&nbsp; Fast driving is severely punished, 
and racing is absolutely prohibited.&nbsp; The men are required to be quiet
and orderly in their deportment in going to and returning from fires.&nbsp;
The engines have the right of way in all the streets.&nbsp; This is well 
understood, and it is astonishing to see the rapidity with which a route is
cleared for them through the most crowded streets.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the fire, communication is made between the plug or 
hydrant and the engine, and the work begins.&nbsp; The chief engineer is 
required to attend all fires, and all orders proceed from him.&nbsp; The 
most rigid discipline is preserved, and the work goes on with a rapidity 
and precision which are in striking contrast to the noise and inefficiency 
of the old system.</p>
<p>A force of policemen is at once sent to a fire.&nbsp; They stretch ropes
across the streets at proper distances from the burning buildings, and no 
one but the members of the Fire Department is allowed to pass these 
barriers.&nbsp; In this way the firemen have room for the performance of 
their duties, lookers-on are kept at a safe distance, and the movable 
property in the burning house is saved from thieves.&nbsp; Merchants and 
others have frequently given grateful testimony to the protection afforded 
their property by the firemen.&nbsp; Upon one occasion the members of the 
department had complete possession for several hours of every part of the 
building containing the immense and valuable stock of jewelry of Messrs. 
Tiffany &amp; Co. This firm made a public declaration that after a rigid 
investigation they had not missed a penny&rsquo;s worth of their property, 
and gratefully acknowledged the protection afforded them.&nbsp; Under the 
old system Messrs. Tiffany &amp; Co. would have been ruined.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="A FIRE IN NEW YORK." src="images/p438.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The life of a fireman is very arduous and dangerous, but the applicants 
for vacancies in the department are numerous.&nbsp; The men are often 
called upon not only to face great personal danger, but they are also 
subjected to a severe physical strain from the <!-- page 439--><a 
name="page439"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 439</span>loss of rest, and 
fatigue.&nbsp; Sometimes they will be called out and worked hard every 
night in the week, and all the while they are required to be as prompt and 
active as though they had never lost a night&rsquo;s rest.&nbsp; They are 
constantly performing deeds of heroism, which pass unnoticed in the bustle 
and whirl of the busy life around them, but which are treasured up in the 
grateful heart of some mother, wife, or parent, whose loved ones owe their 
lives to the fireman&rsquo;s gallantry.</p>
<p>During the recent visit to New York of the Prince Alexis of Russia, a 
pleasing instance of the efficiency of the department was given.&nbsp; The 
Prince had just reviewed a detachment of the department, and had returned 
to his hotel (the Clarendon), in Fourth avenue, just out of Union 
Square.&nbsp; One of the Fire Commissioners proposed to him to test the 
efficiency of the force he had just inspected, and accompanied him to the 
alarm box at the corner of Fourth avenue and Seventeenth street, about half
a block from the hotel.&nbsp; The box being opened, the Prince gave the 
signal, and immediately returned to his hotel.&nbsp; Before he had reached 
the balcony, the sharp clatter of wheels was heard in the distance, and in 
a few seconds several steamers clashed up, &ldquo;breathing fire and 
smoke,&rdquo; followed by a hook and ladder detachment and the Insurance 
Patrol.&nbsp; Within three minutes after the alarm had been sounded, two 
streams were thrown on the Everett House, and within five minutes ladders 
were raised to the hotel windows, and the men were on the roofs of the 
adjoining buildings.</p>
<p>Thanks to the model department, New York feels a security from fires 
unknown until now.&nbsp; The hopes of the friends of the new system have 
been more than realized.&nbsp; The fire statistics speak more eloquently 
than words could, and they show a steady decrease of the loss by 
fire.&nbsp; In 1866, there were 796 fires, involving a loss of $6,428,000; 
in 1867, the number of fires was 873, and the loss $5,711,000; in 1868, the
fires were 740 in number, and the loss was $4,342,371; and in 1869 there 
were 850 fires, with a loss of $2,626,393.&nbsp; In the last mentioned 
year, only 43 out of the 850 fires were communicated to the adjoining 
buildings, a fact which speaks volumes for the exertions of the 
department.</p>
<p><!-- page 440--><a name="page440"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
440</span>The Headquarters of the department are located at 127 Mercer 
street, in a handsome building known as Fireman&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; Here 
are the offices of the Commissioners, the Chief Engineer, Secretary, 
Medical officer, Telegraph Bureau, Bureau of Combustible materials, and 
Fireman&rsquo;s Lyceum.&nbsp; The Lyceum contains a library of over 4000 
volumes, and a collection of engravings, documents, and relics relating to 
the old Fire Department.&nbsp; All fines exacted of firemen, and those 
imposed on citizens for violating the ordinances relating to hatchways and 
kerosene lamps, are paid into the treasury of the &ldquo;Fire Department 
Relief Fund,&rdquo; for the maintenance of the widows and orphans of 
firemen.</p>

441</span>XXXI.&nbsp; THE BUSINESS OF NEW YORK.</h2>
<p>New York is the commercial metropolis of the Union.&nbsp; Its local 
trade is immense, but its foreign trade and its trade with the rest of the 
country are much greater.&nbsp; The port is the American terminus of nearly
all the steamship lines plying between the United States and foreign 
countries.&nbsp; About two-thirds of all the imports of the United States 
arrive in New York, and about forty per cent. of all the exports of the 
country are shipped from the same point.&nbsp; In 1870, the total imports 
amounted to $315,200,022.&nbsp; The Customs duties on these amounted to 
$135,310,995.&nbsp; The imports are given at their foreign cost in gold, 
and freight and duty are not included in this estimate.&nbsp; The exports 
for the same year (including $58,191,475 in specie) were worth 
$254,137,208.&nbsp; The total of imports and exports for that year was 
$569,337,230, the value of the foreign trade of New York.</p>
<p>The domestic trade is also immense.&nbsp; During the year 1864 some of 
the receipts of the port were as follows:</p>

442</span>New York has many advantages over its rivals.&nbsp; Merchants 
find a better and a more extensive and varied market, and as they like to 
combine pleasure with business, find more attractions here than 
elsewhere.&nbsp; New York is emphatically a great city, and it is entirely 
free from provincialisms of any kind.&nbsp; The narrow notions of smaller 
places are quickly replaced here with metropolitan and cosmopolitan ideas, 
tastes and habits.&nbsp; Moreover, the city is the chief centre of wealth, 
of art, of talent, and of luxury.&nbsp; These things are too firmly secured
to be taken away, and strangers must come here to enjoy them.&nbsp; 
Merchants from other States and cities like the liberal and enterprising 
spirit which characterizes the dealings of the New York merchants.&nbsp; 
They can buy here on better terms than elsewhere, and their relations with 
the merchants of this city are generally satisfactory and pleasant.&nbsp; 
Besides this, they find their visits here of real benefit to them in their 
own callings.&nbsp; The energy, or to use an American term, &ldquo;the 
push&rdquo; of New York exhilarates them, and shows them how easily 
difficulties, which in less enterprising places seem insurmountable, may be
overcome.&nbsp; They go back home braced up to their work, and filled with 
new and larger ideas.</p>
<p>Between ten and fifteen millions of strangers annually visit New York 
for business and pleasure.&nbsp; All spend large sums of money during their
stay, and a very large part of this finds its way into the pockets of the 
retail dealers of the city.&nbsp; The hotels, boarding houses, restaurants,
livery stables, and places of amusement reap large profits from these 
visitors.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole city is benefited to a very great extent 
by them, and it thus enjoys a decided advantage over all its rivals.</p>
<p>Everything here gives way to business.&nbsp; The changes in the city 
are, perhaps, more strictly due to this than to the increase of the 
population.&nbsp; It is a common saying that &ldquo;business is rapidly 
coming up town.&rdquo;&nbsp; Private neighborhoods disappear every year, 
and long lines of substantial and elegant warehouses take the places of the
comfortable mansions of other days.&nbsp; The lower part of the city is 
taken up almost exclusively by wholesale and commission houses, and 
manufactories.&nbsp; The retail men <!-- page 443--><a 
name="page443"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 443</span>and small dealers are
being constantly forced higher up town.&nbsp; A few years ago the section 
of the city lying between Fourth and Twenty-third streets was almost 
exclusively a private quarter.&nbsp; Now it is being rapidly invaded by 
business houses.&nbsp; Broadway has scarcely a residence below the 
Park.&nbsp; The lower part of Fifth avenue is being swiftly converted into 
a region of stores and hotels, and residents are being steadily driven out 
of Washington and Union Squares.&nbsp; Even Madison Square is beginning to 
feel the change.&nbsp; But a few years ago it was regarded as the highest 
point that New York would ever reach in its upward growth.</p>
<p>Enterprise, talent, and energy are indispensable to any one who wishes 
to succeed in business in New York.&nbsp; Fortunes can he made legitimately
here quicker than in many other places, but the worker must have 
patience.&nbsp; Fortune comes slowly everywhere if honestly sought.&nbsp; 
There is also another quality indispensable to a genuine success.&nbsp; It 
is honesty and integrity.&nbsp; Sharp practices abound in the city, but 
those who use them find their road a hard one.&nbsp; No man can acquire a 
good and steady credit&mdash;which credit is of more service to him here 
than in almost any other place in the world&mdash;without establishing a 
reputation for rigid integrity.&nbsp; The merchants of the city are keen 
judges of character, and they have no patience with sharpers.&nbsp; They 
will deal with them only on a strictly cash basis.</p>
<p>The city abounds in instances of the success which has attended honest, 
patient, and intelligent efforts.&nbsp; John Jacob Astor was a poor 
butcher&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Cornelius Vanderbilt was a boatman.&nbsp; Daniel
Drew was a drover.&nbsp; The Harpers and Appletons were printers&rsquo; 
apprentices.&nbsp; A. T. Stewart was an humble, struggling 
shopkeeper.&nbsp; A well-known financier began by blacking a pair of 
boots.&nbsp; Opportunities as good as these men ever had are occurring 
every day.&nbsp; Those who are competent to seize them may do so, and rise 
to fortune and position.</p>
<p>Many of the colossal fortunes of the city have been created by the rise 
in the value of real estate.&nbsp; The rapid growth of the city during the 
past twelve years has greatly increased the value of property in the upper 
sections.&nbsp; Many persons who <!-- page 444--><a 
name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 444</span>but a few years ago 
were owners of tracts which were simply burdensome by reason of the 
numerous and heavy assessments upon them, and for which no purchasers could
be found, have become very wealthy by the rapid increase in the value of 
their property.&nbsp; Many persons owning property of this kind sold at a 
heavy advance during the real estate speculations that succeeded the 
war.&nbsp; Others leased their lands to parties wishing to build on 
them.&nbsp; Others still hold on for further improvement.&nbsp; The Astors,
A. T. Stewart, Vanderbilt and others have made a large share of their money
by their investments in real estate.</p>
<p>A farm near the Central Park, which could not find a purchaser in 1862, 
when it was offered at a few thousand dollars, sold in 1868 in building 
lots for almost as many millions.</p>
<p>In 1860 a gentleman purchased a handsome house in a fashionable 
neighborhood.&nbsp; It was a corner house and fronted on Fifth 
avenue.&nbsp; He paid $50,000 for it, and spent $25,000 more in fitting up 
and furnishing it.&nbsp; His friends shook their heads at his 
extravagance.&nbsp; Since then he has resided in the house, and each year 
his property has increased in value.&nbsp; In 1869 he was offered nearly 
$300,000 dollars for the house and furniture, but refused to sell at this 
price, believing that he would be able in a few years to command a still 
larger sum.</p>
<h2><!-- page 445--><a name="page445"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
445</span>XXXII.&nbsp; THE SABBATH IN NEW YORK.</h2>
<p>On Sunday morning New York puts on its holiday dress.&nbsp; The stores 
are closed, the streets have a deserted aspect, for the crowds of vehicles,
animals and human beings that fill them on other days are absent.&nbsp; 
There are no signs of trade anywhere except in the Bowery and Chatham 
street.&nbsp; The city has an appearance of cleanliness and quietness 
pleasant to behold.&nbsp; The wharves are hushed and still, and the river 
and bay lie calm and bright in the light of the Sabbath sun.&nbsp; One 
misses the stages from Broadway, and a stranger at once credits the 
coachmen with a greater regard for the day than their brothers of the 
street cars.&nbsp; The fact is, however, that Jehu of the stagecoach rests 
on the Sabbath because his business would be unprofitable on that 
day.&nbsp; The people who patronize him in the week have no use for him on 
Sunday.&nbsp; The horse-cars make their trips as in the week.&nbsp; They 
are a necessity in so large a city.&nbsp; The distances one is compelled to
pass over here, even on Sunday, are too great to be traversed on foot.</p>
<p>Towards ten o&rsquo;clock the streets begin to fill up with 
churchgoers.&nbsp; The cars are crowded, and handsome carriages dash by 
conveying their owners to their places of worship.&nbsp; The uptown 
churches are the most fashionable, and are the best attended, but all the 
sacred edifices are well filled on Sunday morning.&nbsp; New York 
compromises with its conscience by a scrupulous attendance upon morning 
worship, and reserves the rest of the day for its own convenience.&nbsp; 
The up-town churches all strive to get in, or as near as possible to, the 
Fifth avenue.&nbsp; One reason for this is, doubtless, the desire that all 
well-to-do New Yorkers have to participate in the after-church 
promenade.&nbsp; <!-- page 446--><a name="page446"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 446</span>The churches close their services near about 
the same hour, and then each pours its throng of fashionably dressed people
into the avenue.&nbsp; The congregations of distant churches all find their
way to the avenue, and for about an hour after church the splendid street 
presents a very attractive spectacle.&nbsp; The toilettes of the ladies 
show well here, and it is a pleasant place to meet one&rsquo;s 
acquaintances.</p>
<p>The majority of New Yorkers dine at one o&rsquo;clock on Sunday, the 
object being to allow the servants the afternoon for themselves.&nbsp; 
After dinner your New Yorker, male or female, thinks of enjoyment.&nbsp; If
the weather is fair the fashionables promenade the Fifth and Madison 
avenues, or drive in the park.&nbsp; The working classes fill the 
street-cars, and throng the Central Park.&nbsp; In the summer whole 
families of laboring people go to the park early in the morning, taking a 
lunch with them, and there spend the entire day.&nbsp; In the skating 
season the lakes are thronged with skaters.&nbsp; The church bells ring out
mournfully towards three o&rsquo;clock, but few persons answer the 
call.&nbsp; The afternoon congregations are wofully thin.</p>
<p>In the mild season, the adjacent rivers and the harbor are thronged with
pleasure boats filled with excursionists, and the various horse and steam 
railway lines leading from the city to the sea-shore are well 
patronized.</p>
<p>Broadway wears a silent and deserted aspect all day long, but towards 
sunset the Bowery brightens up wonderfully, and after nightfall the street 
is ablaze with a thousand gaslights.&nbsp; The low class theatres and 
places of amusement in that thoroughfare are opened towards dark, and then 
vice reigns triumphant in the Bowery.&nbsp; The Bowery beer-gardens do a 
good business.&nbsp; The most of them are provided with orchestras or huge 
orchestrions, and these play music from the ritual of the Roman Catholic 
Church.</p>
<p>Until very recently the bar-rooms were closed from midnight on Saturday 
until midnight on Sunday, and during that period the sale of intoxicating 
liquors was prohibited.&nbsp; Now all this is changed.&nbsp; The bar-rooms 
do a good business on Sunday, and especially on Sunday night.&nbsp; The 
Monday morning papers tell <!-- page 447--><a name="page447"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 447</span>a fearful tale of crimes committed on the holy
day.&nbsp; Assaults, fights, murders, robberies, and minor offences are 
reported in considerable numbers.&nbsp; Drunkenness is very common, and the
Monday Police Courts have plenty of work to do.</p>
<p>At night the churches are better attended than in the afternoon, but not
as well as in the morning.</p>
<p>Sunday concerts, given at first-class places of amusement, are now quite
common.&nbsp; The music consists of masses, and other sacred airs, varied 
with selections from popular operas.&nbsp; The performers are famous 
throughout the country for their musical skill, and the audiences are large
and fashionable.&nbsp; No one seems to think it sinful thus to desecrate 
the Lord&rsquo;s Day; and it must be confessed that these concerts are the 
least objectionable Sunday amusements known to our people.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that the dissipation of which we have spoken is 
confined exclusively to the rougher class.&nbsp; Old and young men of 
respectable position participate in it as well.&nbsp; Some are never called
on to answer for it, others get into trouble with the police 
authorities.&nbsp; One reason for this dissipation is plain.&nbsp; People 
are so much engrossed in the pursuit of wealth that they really have no 
leisure time in the week.&nbsp; They must take Sunday for relaxation and 
recreation, and they grudge the few hours in the morning that decency 
requires them to pass in church.</p>
<h2><!-- page 448--><a name="page448"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
448</span>XXXIII.&nbsp; THE POST-OFFICE</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS.</h3>
<p>Strange to say, the great metropolis, in which the largest postal 
business in the country is transacted, has never had a building for a 
Post-office, which was erected for that purpose.&nbsp; It has been 
compelled to put up with any temporary accommodation that could be 
obtained, and for many years past its Post-office has been simply a 
disgrace to the nation.</p>
<p>In the days of the Dutch, letters were brought over from Europe by the 
shipmasters and delivered to some coffee house keeper, who took charge of 
them until the persons to whom they were addressed could call for 
them.&nbsp; This custom was continued under the English until 1686, when 
the authorities required that all ship letters should be placed in charge 
of the Collector of the Port.&nbsp; In 1692, the city authorities 
established a Post-office, and in 1710, the Postmaster-General of Great 
Britain removed the headquarters of the postal service of the Colonies from
Philadelphia to New York.&nbsp; The first city Post-office was located in 
Broadway opposite Beaver street.&nbsp; About the year 1804, the Post-office
was removed to No. 29 William street, corner of Garden street, now Exchange
Place, where it remained until 1825, when the Government leased the 
&ldquo;Academy building&rdquo; in Garden street, now Exchange Place, and 
opened it as a Post-office.&nbsp; In 1827, the office was transferred to 
the basement of the Merchants&rsquo; Exchange, the site now occupied by the
Custom House.&nbsp; Wall street was then just undergoing the <!-- page 
449--><a name="page449"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 449</span>change from 
private residences to bankers&rsquo; and brokers&rsquo; offices.&nbsp; The 
Merchants&rsquo; Exchange was destroyed in the great fire of 1835, and the 
next day a Post-office was extemporized in a brick building in Pine, near 
Nassau street, and shortly after was transferred to the Rotunda, in the 
City Hall Park, which had been offered to the Government by the municipal 
authorities.&nbsp; The Rotunda, however, proved too small for the business 
of the department, which had been greatly increased by the establishment of
lines of railways and steamboats between New York and the various parts of 
the country, and in 1845 the Post-office was removed to the Middle Dutch 
Church, in Nassau street, between Pine and Cedar streets, its present 
location, which was purchased by the Government for the sum of 
$350,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p449.jpg">
<img alt="THE OLD POST-OFFICE." src="images/p449.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This building has always been entirely unsuited to the needs of a 
Post-office for such a city as New York.&nbsp; It was dedicated in 1732, 
and was used for worship by one of the Dutch congregations of the 
city.&nbsp; In 1776, the British having occupied the <!-- page 450--><a 
name="page450"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 450</span>city, it was 
converted into a prison by the conquerors for the incarceration of their 
rebellious captives.&nbsp; It was subsequently used by them as a riding 
school for the instruction of cavalry.&nbsp; After the British evacuated 
the city, the congregation reoccupied it, and refitted it for religious 
worship.&nbsp; After paying for it the large sum mentioned above, the 
Government was compelled to make a further expenditure of $80,000, to fit 
it up for its new uses.&nbsp; Since then many changes, some involving a 
heavy outlay, have been made in the building, but even now it is not 
capable of meeting the demands upon it, and the Government is now engaged 
in the erection of a new building expressly designed for a Post-office.</p>
<p>The Pine street front is devoted to the reception and departure of the 
mails.&nbsp; The street is generally filled with wagons bearing the mystic 
words, &ldquo;U.S. Mail.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some are single-horse vehicles, used 
for carrying the bags between the main office and the numerous stations 
scattered through the city; others are immense wagons, drawn by four and 
six horses, and carrying several tons of matter at a time.&nbsp; These are 
used for the great Eastern, Western, and Southern, and the Foreign 
Mails.&nbsp; The Pine street doors present a busy sight at all hours, and 
the duties of the men employed there are not light.&nbsp; Huge sacks from 
all parts of the world are arriving nearly every hour, and immense piles of
similar sacks are dispatched with the regularity of clockwork.</p>
<p>The body of the building, by which is meant the old church room itself, 
is used for opening and making up the mails.&nbsp; This work is carried on 
on the main floor, and in the heavy, old-fashioned gallery which runs 
around three of the sides.&nbsp; Huge semi-circular forms are scattered 
about the floor, each divided into a number of open squares.&nbsp; From 
each of these squares hangs a mail bag, each square being marked with the 
name of the city or town to which the bag is to be sent.&nbsp; A clerk 
stands within the curve of the form, before a table filled with letters and
papers, and tosses them one by one into the squares to which they 
belong.&nbsp; This is done with the utmost rapidity, and long practice has 
made the clerk so proficient that he never <!-- page 451--><a 
name="page451"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 451</span>misses the proper 
square.&nbsp; The stamping of the office mark and cancelling of the postage
stamps on letters to be sent away is incessant, and the room resounds with 
the heavy thud of the stamp.&nbsp; This is no slight work, as the clerks 
who perform it can testify.&nbsp; The upper floor is devoted to the use of 
the Post-Master and his Assistants, the Superintendent of the City 
Delivery, and the Money Order and Registered Letter Offices.&nbsp; A wooden
corridor has been built along the side of the church along Nassau and Cedar
streets, and here, on the street floor, are the box and general deliveries,
and the stamp windows.&nbsp; This is the public portion of the office, and 
is always thronged.</p>
<p>The visitor will notice, in various parts of this corridor, the slides 
for the depositing of letters and papers intended for the mails.&nbsp; The 
accumulation of mail matter here is so great that it is necessary that 
letters designed for a certain part of the country should be deposited in 
one particular place.&nbsp; Letters for New England must be placed in a 
certain box, those for the Middle States in another, those for the Southern
States in another, those for the West in another.&nbsp; The names of the 
States are painted conspicuously above each box, so that there may be no 
mistake on the part of strangers.&nbsp; Letters for the principal countries
of Europe and Asia are posted in the same way.&nbsp; Newspapers and 
periodicals have a separate department.&nbsp; The mails of these journals 
are made up in the office of publication, according to certain instructions
furnished by the Postmaster, and go to the Post-office properly assorted 
for distribution.&nbsp; This system of depositing mail matter saves an 
immense amount of labor on the part of the clerks, and also hastens the 
departure of the mails from the office.</p>
<p>The Box Delivery contains nearly seven thousand boxes, on each of which 
the enormous rent of $16 per annum is charged.&nbsp; Considering that the 
box system is quite as advantageous to the Government as to the box holder,
this rent is simply extortionate.</p>
<p>The daily business of the New York Post-office is enormous, and is 
rapidly increasing.&nbsp; The letters received by mail steamers from 
foreign countries, partly for delivery in the city, and partly <!-- page 
452--><a name="page452"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 452</span>to be 
forwarded to other places, average about fifteen thousand daily.&nbsp; The 
number dispatched from this office by steamer to foreign countries is about
seventeen thousand daily.&nbsp; The number of letters sent from New York to
other offices in the United States is about one hundred and fifty-five 
thousand daily.&nbsp; The number received from domestic offices for 
delivery in the city is about one hundred and twenty-six thousand daily; in
addition to about seventy-two thousand per day, which are to be forwarded 
to other offices.&nbsp; About one hundred thousand letters, and about 
twenty thousand printed circulars, are mailed every day in the city, for 
city delivery.&nbsp; The carriers deliver daily, to persons who do not hire
boxes at the general office, about fifty-three thousand letters; and 
collect from the street boxes about one hundred and one thousand letters 
every twenty-four hours.&nbsp; About five hundred registered letters, of 
which about four hundred are for delivery in the city, are received, and 
about two hundred and fifty are dispatched, daily.&nbsp; About one thousand
dollars are paid out daily on money orders, and a much larger amount is 
received for orders granted to applicants.&nbsp; The sales of postage 
stamps amount to about forty-four thousand dollars per week.&nbsp; About 
two hundred unstamped letters are deposited in the office daily, and about 
one hundred letters on which the name of the town or State is written 
improperly, or on which the address is illegible.&nbsp; These are all sent 
to the Dead Letter Office, in Washington.</p>
<p>The number of persons employed as clerks, porters, etc., in the general 
office and the various stations, is 715.</p>
<p>The city is too large to admit of the transaction of all its business by
the general office.&nbsp; To meet the necessities of the town, and to 
insure the rapid dispatch of the postal business, about 700 
&ldquo;lamp-post boxes,&rdquo; or iron boxes attached to the posts of the 
street lamps, are scattered through the city.&nbsp; Letters for the mails 
and for delivery in the city are deposited in these boxes, from which they 
are collected by the letter-carriers nine times each day, except Sunday, 
between the hours of seven A.M. and seven P.M.&nbsp; The Sunday collection 
is made once, at seven in the evening.</p>
<p><!-- page 453--><a name="page453"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
453</span>There are fourteen branch or Sub-Post-offices, designated as 
&ldquo;Stations,&rdquo; located in convenient parts of the city, north of 
the general office.&nbsp; They are named from the letters of the alphabet, 
and are known as &ldquo;Stations A, B, C, D, E, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, and 
O.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are designed to serve as distributing centres for 
certain sections of the city.&nbsp; They receive from the general office 
all letters and papers for delivery in their sections, and to them the 
carriers bring all the matter collected from the lamp-boxes.&nbsp; There is
no delivery from them except through the carriers.&nbsp; They dispatch to 
the general office, at stated times throughout the day, all matter 
deposited in their boxes or collected from the lamp-boxes by the 
carriers.</p>
<p>A recent writer thus relates some of the gossip connected with the 
office:</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who come to the Post-office and make complaints of being 
robbed, when they discover that they were mistaken never call and make 
reparation, or relieve the department of the charge made against its 
employ&eacute;s.&nbsp; A merchant, much excited, complained that a letter 
sent to him &lsquo;by a most responsible house,&rsquo; containing $500, had
not been received.&nbsp; This charge was fortified by showing a letter from
the postmaster who mailed the missing letter, certifying that it was 
forwarded, and contained the $500.&nbsp; Detectives were at once set to 
work to unravel the iniquity, but all efforts proved unavailing.&nbsp; 
Finally the Post-office authorities, after weeks of hard work, called on 
the complaining merchant and asked if he had heard anything about the 
missing money.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; replied the gentleman, with great 
vivacity, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all right; by mistake that letter was thrown 
into the safe, and remained unopened nearly four weeks.&nbsp; Funny, 
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;&nbsp; Not even an apology was made for charging the
Post-office with purloining the money, or for giving its officers so much 
unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charges of dishonesty against the Post-office are made where 
nobody but &lsquo;extraordinary circumstances&rsquo; are to blame.&nbsp; A 
letter containing two $1000 bills in it was delivered by the carrier, who, 
according to custom (ignorant of its contents, of course), at the house of 
its owner, shoved it into the hallway, under the <!-- page 454--><a 
name="page454"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 454</span>door.&nbsp; The 
letter was missing.&nbsp; Complaint was made at the Post-office; evidence 
was produced that the money had been forwarded.&nbsp; The detectives were 
set to work to trace out the robbery.&nbsp; The poor carrier, and the 
clerks in the office who handled the letter were placed under 
surveillance.&nbsp; The clerks where the letter was mailed were 
&lsquo;shadowed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Every dollar they expended after the probable
robbery was secretly inquired into, to see if any of them had been at any 
given time, after the letter was lost, unusually &lsquo;flush;&rsquo; but 
all signs failed.&nbsp; After a long time the floor covering of the hall 
was taken up, and there was the letter, &lsquo;safe and sound;&rsquo; the 
unfortunate carrier had thrust it under, instead of over, the oilcloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The misdirection of letters is the cause of serious charges 
against the Post-office.&nbsp; A letter containing $700 was mailed from 
Albany to New York.&nbsp; It was sent from a well-known person, and the 
package which was supposed to contain the letter, made up in Albany, was 
not opened until it reached New York.&nbsp; Both ends of the line were 
under suspicion.&nbsp; It was stated that the letter was addressed to Mr. 
--- ---, Broadway, New York.&nbsp; After a long search it was found that 
the letter had never left Albany at all, being directed by mistake, Mr. ---
---, Broadway, Albany, and the faithful clerks had thrown it into their own
city delivery box instead of forwarding it to New York.&nbsp; The confusion
in the mind of the writer grew out of the fact that there is a Broadway in 
both cities, and from force of habit he wrote the wrong address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miserable chirography is one of the most prolific causes of 
Post-office inefficiency.&nbsp; It is safe to say that unmistakably written
directions would remove nine-tenths of the complaints.&nbsp; What is a 
non-plussed clerk to do with letters addressed to &lsquo;Mahara 
Seney,&rsquo; &lsquo;Old Cort,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Cow House,&rsquo; when 
Morrisonia, Olcott, and Cohoes were really intended?</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, possibly four years ago, Mr. Kelly was sitting in his 
private office opening his <i>personal</i> letters, and enjoying the 
delusion that everything was working satisfactorily, when, to his surprise,
he found one letter from Washington calling his especial attention to the 
&lsquo;inclosed editorial,&rsquo; cut from the <!-- page 455--><a 
name="page455"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 455</span><i>Tribune</i>, in 
which the carelessness of his clerks, and the generally unsatisfactory 
manner with which he carried on his business, were dilated upon, ending 
with the startling announcement that, under the present management of the 
department, it took <i>four days</i> to get a letter from New York to 
Chappaqua, distance about thirty miles, and made literally no distance by a
fast railway!&nbsp; Consternation ensued, and Mr. Kelly, to commence 
examination into these serious charges, sent a special agent to Chappaqua 
for the envelope of said delayed letter.&nbsp; At the place named the 
official fortunately not only found what he went after (the envelope), but 
also Mr. Greeley and &lsquo;Miles O&rsquo;Reilly.&rsquo;&nbsp; After due 
explanations, the envelope was handed to Miles O&rsquo;Reilly, with the 
query of what he thought was the meaning of the superscription.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rsquo; said that genial wit, who had once been a deputy 
postmaster, &lsquo;the devil himself couldn&rsquo;t make it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The envelope was then brought to the attention of the berated 
clerks, who looked at it with glazed eyes, the hieroglyphics suggesting 
somewhat the same intellectual speculation that would result from studying 
the footprints of a gigantic spider that had, after wading knee-deep in 
ink, retreated hastily across the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Post-office, when they distribute letters, those on which 
the direction is not instantly made out, to save time, are thrown in a pile
for especial examination; if a second and more careful study fails, they 
are consigned to an especial clerk, who is denominated the chief of the 
bureau of &lsquo;hards.&rsquo;&nbsp; To this important functionary the 
envelope of Chappaqua was at last referred.&nbsp; He examined it a moment, 
and his eye flashed with the expression of recognizing an old 
acquaintance.&nbsp; &lsquo;This thing,&rsquo; said he, holding up the 
envelope with the tip ends of his fingers, &lsquo;came to me some days ago 
along with the other &ldquo;hards.&rdquo;&nbsp; I studied the 
superscription at my leisure a whole day, but couldn&rsquo;t make it 
out.&nbsp; I then showed it to the best experts in handwriting attached to 
the office, and called on outsiders to test their skill; but what the 
writing meant, <i>if it was writing</i>, was a conundrum that we all gave 
up.&nbsp; Finally, in <!-- page 456--><a name="page456"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 456</span>desperation, it was suggested, as a last 
resort, to send it to Chappaqua, which happened to be its place of 
destination.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such is the <i>literal</i> history of the reason 
of an earnestly written denunciation of the inefficiency of the city 
post.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; THE NEW POST-OFFICE.</h3>
<p>In 1869, the General Government decided to depart from the niggardly 
policy it had hitherto pursued towards the City of New York, and to take 
steps toward the erection of a Post-office adequate to the needs of the 
great and growing community which demanded this act of justice at its 
hands.&nbsp; It was decided to erect an edifice which should be an ornament
to the city, and capable of accommodating the City Postal service for 
generations to come.&nbsp; The Municipal Authorities, in order to secure 
the erection of the building in the most convenient part of the city, 
offered to sell to the General Government the lower end of the City Hall 
Park.&nbsp; The offer was accepted, and the land was purchased by the 
Government.&nbsp; The corner stone was laid in June, 1869.&nbsp; At the 
present writing (January, 1872,) the first story has been finished.&nbsp; 
It will probably require several years to complete the edifice.&nbsp; The 
price paid for the land was $500,000, a merely nominal sum.&nbsp; It is 
expected that the building will cost about $4,000,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The exterior walls are to be of Dix Island granite, and the 
dimensions of the four fronts are severally as follows: the northerly side 
(toward the City Hall) is about 300 feet; the Broadway and Park Row fronts,
respectively, 270 feet; and the southerly part, 130 feet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p457.jpg">
<img alt="THE NEW POST-OFFICE." src="images/p457.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The difficulty of laying the foundations may be judged from the 
following facts: The depth of excavation over the entire plot was over 
thirty feet, and the material to be removed was entirely loose sand, while 
the traffic in Broadway and Park Row, including railroad cars and 
omnibuses, was enormous, involving the danger of a caving-in of both 
streets!&nbsp; The trenches <!-- page 458--><a name="page458"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 458</span>in which the retaining walls and pier 
foundations were to be laid had to be completely incased in sheet-piling, 
shored across with timbers, under the protection of which the excavation 
was carried on and the masonry laid.&nbsp; The excavation was done mostly 
at night, the ground being illuminated by magnesium light.&nbsp; The outer 
walls, and those of the court, and the foundations of the interior columns 
are based on huge granite blocks, the granite being laid on massive beds of
concrete.&nbsp; One hundred and fifty-nine iron columns in the basement, 
and 117 in the first story, support the walls and floors.&nbsp; The piers 
of the cellar are of granite, or arcaded brick and iron; the stairs are of 
stone and iron; the chimneys, of stone; the roof and its ornaments, of 
iron, covered with slate and copper.&nbsp; Four large low-pressure boilers 
supply the steam for heating the entire building.&nbsp; The roofs of the 
corner pavilions rise 107 feet above the sidewalk.&nbsp; The cellar is a 
little more than seven feet in the clear; the basement, sixteen feet; the 
first corridor, fourteen feet; and the half-story above it&mdash;both 
completing the first story&mdash;also fourteen feet.&nbsp; The entire 
circuit of the building is over one-fifth of a mile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The style of architecture is the classical Italian Renaissance, 
with some modifications to harmonize with the treatment of the roofs, which
are to be French, as best suited to such architecture on a large 
scale.&nbsp; The Mansard roof will be covered with an ironclad cornice and 
metallic cresting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The irregular angles imposed by the shape of the lot are marked 
by semi-hexagonal pavilions.&nbsp; The main building line is withdrawn from
the lower, or southerly front, to extend the fa&ccedil;ade on that 
side.&nbsp; The roof, square-domed, rests on three arms of a Greek cross, 
out of the centre of which rises a heavily buttressed cupola, carrying 
projecting pediments, with detached columns on its four faces.&nbsp; The 
foot of the flagstaff, which is to surmount the cupola, will be 160 feet 
above the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fronts on Broadway and Park Row, respectively, are broken by 
square central pavilions, with pyramidal roofs, of which the first and 
second stories are faced with detached colonnades of coupled columns.&nbsp;
Below are the main lateral entrances <!-- page 459--><a 
name="page459"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 459</span>to the Post-office 
corridor.&nbsp; The centre of the largest and northerly front is relieved 
by a broad pavilion with a two-story colonnade, roofed with a dome, the 
balustrade of which is 150 feet above the sidewalk.&nbsp; The dome is 
lighted by a range of round windows, and surmounted by an attic, ornamented
by a sculptured pediment and a crown with the national arms.&nbsp; The form
of the building is, substantially, a trapezoid, with an open triangular 
court in the centre, below the main story; it includes a sub-basement, 
basement, three stories in the walls, and a roof story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A drive-way, or street, forty feet in width, reserved from the 
northerly side of the ground purchased by the Government, serves as an 
approach to that front, and secures the perfect isolation of the building, 
with perpetual access of light and air on that side, as well as on the 
other sides, whatever changes may hereafter be made in the adjoining 
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The principal entrances are at the south west front under a 
portico, which gives access to the Post-office corridor, and by a broad 
double staircase to the upper stories; and at the northerly corner 
pavilions on Broadway and Park Row, where two great elliptical stairways 
lead again to the higher stories, but do not communicate with the 
ground-floor, being reserved for the United States Courts, and their 
dependencies.&nbsp; Besides these, there are lateral entrances to the 
Post-office corridor on Broadway and Park Row, and to the Post-office 
proper on those two sides, and also on the northerly front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sub-basement, or cellar, and the basement, cover the whole 
area of the lot, and are extended under the sidewalks, the central court 
and the drive-way on the northerly side.&nbsp; The cellar will be used for 
the boilers, engines and heating apparatus, and for the storage of coal and
other bulky material.&nbsp; The basements and the first story are reserved 
for the use of the Post-office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first story occupies the entire space of the building, 
including the central court, which is here roofed with glass; the walls of 
which, with all the interior partitions of the stories above, are, in this 
story and the basement, carried on columns, leaving the whole area of the 
Post-office roof open to light and free use and communication.</p>
<p><!-- page 460--><a name="page460"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
460</span>&ldquo;The corridor for the use of the public occupies the 
exterior belt of the ground-floor on the southerly front, and on the 
Broadway and Park Row fronts far enough to include the central pavilions, 
and it is separated from the Post-office room by a Box and Delivery 
screen.&nbsp; This corridor is half the height of the first story, and the 
space above it is occupied by a half-story, which, being entirely open on 
the inside, forms a gallery encompassing the Post-office room on three 
sides.&nbsp; The high windows of the first story, running through both the 
corridor and the half-story, give an uninterrupted communication of light 
and air to the interior, while the supply of light is increased by the 
whole breadth of the glass roof over the court.&nbsp; The floor under this 
floor is also of glass, giving light to the sub-basement, which is also 
lighted by means of illuminating tile in the sidewalks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the upper stories, corridors fourteen feet wide make the 
circuit of the whole building; and from those corridors, rooms open on 
either hand toward the streets and the inner court.&nbsp; The rooms over 
the principal entrance, and which look down Broadway, are reserved for the 
Postmaster; and those for the Assistant Postmaster and Cashier are close at
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole of the northerly front is given to the United States 
Courts.&nbsp; There are three court-rooms, of which the two largest are 
continued up through two stories in height.&nbsp; Adjoining these, are 
special rooms for the Judges, near which private stairways furnish the only
access to the jury-rooms in the third story.&nbsp; The remainder of the 
second story is occupied by rooms for Marshals, United States Attorney, 
Clerks of the Courts, record-rooms, etc., etc.&nbsp; Other United States 
officers are to be accommodated with rooms in the upper story.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; THE LETTER CARRIERS.</h3>
<p>For the purpose of distributing the letters received at the New York 
Post-office, the Government has organized a force <!-- page 461--><a 
name="page461"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 461</span>of Letter Carriers, 
or, as they are sometimes called, &ldquo;Postmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; All letters 
that are addressed to the places of business or the residences of citizens,
unless such persons are renters of boxes in the General Post-office, are 
turned over to the Carriers for delivery.</p>
<p>The force is organized under the direction of a Superintendent, who is 
appointed by and responsible to the Postmaster of the city.&nbsp; 
Applicants for positions in the force of Letter Carriers must, as a prime 
necessity, be able to command a sufficient degree of political influence to
secure their appointments.&nbsp; Possessing this, they make their 
applications in duplicate, on blank forms supplied by the Department.&nbsp;
The applicant must state his age, general condition, former occupation, 
experience in business, his reason for leaving his last place, and whether 
he has served in the army or navy.&nbsp; One of these applications is laid 
before the Postmaster of the city, and the other is sent to the Post-office
Department at Washington.&nbsp; If the applicant is successful, he is 
subjected to a physical examination by the surgeon of the Department, in 
order to make sure of his bodily soundness.&nbsp; Good eye-sight is 
imperatively required of every applicant.&nbsp; If &ldquo;passed&rdquo; by 
the surgeon, the applicant must then furnish two bonds in five hundred 
dollars each, for the faithful performance of his duties.&nbsp; This done, 
he is enrolled as a member of the corps of Letter Carriers, and is assigned
by the Superintendent of the force to a station.</p>
<p>Together with his certificate of appointment, the Superintendent hands 
him an order on a certain firm of tailors for an &ldquo;outfit,&rdquo; or 
uniform, which consists of a coat, pants, vest, and cap of gray cloth, 
trimmed with black braid, and with gilt buttons.&nbsp; The cost of this 
uniform is in winter twenty-four dollars, and in summer twenty 
dollars.&nbsp; It is paid for by the Post-office Department, and the amount
deducted from the first two months&rsquo; pay of the carrier.</p>
<p>Upon being assigned to a station, the Carrier is required to commit to 
memory the rules laid down for his guidance.&nbsp; His route is then marked
out for him, and he is frequently accompanied over it several times by an 
older member of the force to <!-- page 462--><a name="page462"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 462</span>familiarize him with it.&nbsp; The 
Superintendent of the Station is his immediate superior.&nbsp; From him the
Carrier receives his orders, and to him submits his reports.</p>
<p>There is a &ldquo;time-book&rdquo; kept in each station, in which the 
employ&eacute;s are required to enter the time of their arrival at the 
station in the morning.&nbsp; The Carriers are also required to enter the 
time of their departure on their routes, and the time of their return to 
the station.&nbsp; Once a month this book is submitted to the inspection of
the Superintendent of the force, and any delays or other negligences that 
are noted are reprimanded by him.</p>
<p>The Station-clerk, whose duty it is to assort the mail, is required to 
be at his post at ten minutes after six o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp;
He places each Carrier&rsquo;s mail in a separate box, leaving to him the 
arrangement of it.&nbsp; The Carriers must be at the station at half-past 
six.&nbsp; They at once proceed to arrange their mail in such a manner as 
will facilitate its prompt delivery, and at half-past seven A.M., they 
start out on their routes.&nbsp; If any of the postage on the letters to be
delivered is unpaid, it is charged by the clerk to the Carrier, who is held
responsible for its collection.&nbsp; Once a week the Superintendent of the
Station goes over the accounts of the Carriers, and requires them to pay 
over to him all the sums charged against them.</p>
<p>There are nine deliveries from the stations every day.&nbsp; The first 
at half-past seven A.M., and the last at five P.M.&nbsp; This entails an 
immense amount of labor upon the Carriers.&nbsp; They are obliged to 
perform their duties regardless of the weather, and are subjected to an 
exposure which is very trying to them.&nbsp; They are very efficient, and 
perform their task faithfully and promptly.</p>
<p>The pay of a carrier is small.&nbsp; By law he is entitled to $800 per 
annum for the first six months.&nbsp; After this he is to receive $900 per 
annum, and at the expiration of one year, he may, upon the recommendation 
of the Superintendent of the Station, receive an additional $100 per annum;
but $1000 is the limit.&nbsp; It is said, however, that it is very rare for
a carrier to receive an increase of salary before the expiration of one 
year.&nbsp; Why <!-- page 463--><a name="page463"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 463</span>he is subjected to this loss, in defiance of 
the law, the writer has been unable to ascertain.</p>
<p>Although the pay is so small, the Carrier is not allowed to enjoy it in 
peace.&nbsp; The party in power, or rather its managers, tax him 
unmercifully.&nbsp; From one to two per cent. of his salary is deducted for
party expenses, and he is required to contribute at least five dollars to 
the expenses of every City and State election.&nbsp; The Postmaster of the 
city does not trouble himself about this robbery of his employ&eacute;s, 
but allows it to go on with his indirect approval, at least.&nbsp; General 
Dix has the honor of being the only Postmaster who ever had the moral 
courage to protect his subordinates from this extortion.</p>
<p>The Carriers have organized a benevolent association among 
themselves.&nbsp; Upon the death of a member, each surviving member of the 
association makes a contribution of two dollars to the relief fund.&nbsp; 
From this fund the funeral expenses are paid, and the surplus is handed 
over to the widow and children of the dead man.</p>
<p>The tenure by which the Carriers hold their positions is very 
uncertain.&nbsp; A new Postmaster may remove any or all of them, to make 
way for his political friends, and any refusal on their part to submit to 
the orders or extortions of their party-managers is sure to result in a 
dismissal.</p>

464</span>XXXIV.&nbsp; A. T. STEWART.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Alexander T. Stewart</span> was born in Belfast, in 
Ireland, in 1802.&nbsp; He is of Scotch-Irish parentage.&nbsp; At the age 
of three years he lost his father, and was adopted by his grandfather, who 
gave him a good common school and collegiate education, intending him for 
the ministry.&nbsp; His grandfather died during his collegiate course, and 
this threw him upon his own resources.&nbsp; He at once abandoned all hope 
of a professional career, and set sail for America.&nbsp; He reached New 
York in 1818, and began his career here as assistant teacher in a 
commercial school.&nbsp; His first salary was $300.&nbsp; In a year or two 
he went into business for himself, carrying on a modest little store, and 
manifesting no especial talent for business.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-one, he went back to Ireland to take possession of 
a legacy of nearly one thousand pounds, left him by his grandfather.&nbsp; 
He invested the greater part of this sum in &ldquo;insertions&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;scollop trimmings,&rdquo; and returned to New York.&nbsp; He rented 
a little store at 283 Broadway, and there displayed his stock, which he 
sold readily at a fair profit.&nbsp; His store was next door to the then 
popular Bonafanti, who kept the largest and best patronized variety store 
of the day.&nbsp; Stewart&rsquo;s little room was twenty-two feet wide by 
twenty feet deep.</p>
<p>Without mercantile experience, and possessing no advantage but his 
determination to succeed, Mr. Stewart started boldly on what proved the 
road to fortune.&nbsp; He gave from fourteen to eighteen hours per day to 
his business.&nbsp; He could not afford to employ any help, and he did all 
his own work.&nbsp; He was almost a total stranger to the business 
community of New York, and he had no credit.&nbsp; He kept a small stock of
goods on hand, <!-- page 465--><a name="page465"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 465</span>which he bought for cash and sold in the same 
way for a small profit.&nbsp; His purchases were made chiefly at auctions, 
and consisted of &ldquo;sample lots&rdquo;&mdash;that is, miscellaneous 
collections of small articles thrown together in heaps and sold for what 
they would bring.&nbsp; He spent several hours after business each day in 
assorting and dressing these goods.&nbsp; They were sold at a low price, 
but his profit was fair, as he had paid but a trifle for them.&nbsp; Little
by little his trade increased, and he was soon obliged to employ an 
assistant.&nbsp; About this time he inaugurated the system of 
&ldquo;selling off below cost.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had a note to pay, and no 
money to meet it.&nbsp; His store was full of goods, but he was short of 
ready money.&nbsp; No man could then afford to let his note go to 
protest.&nbsp; Such a step in those days meant financial ruin to a young 
man.&nbsp; Stewart proved himself the man for the crisis.&nbsp; He marked 
every article in his store down far below the wholesale price, and 
scattered over the city a cloud of handbills announcing that he would 
dispose of his entire stock of goods below cost within a given time.&nbsp; 
His announcement drew crowds of purchasers to his store, and before the 
period he had fixed for the duration of the sale, Mr. Stewart found his 
shelves empty and his treasury full.&nbsp; He paid his note with a part of 
the money thus obtained, and with the rest laid in a fresh stock of 
goods.&nbsp; He made his purchases at a time when the market was very dull,
and, as he paid cash, secured his goods at very low prices.</p>
<p>The energy and business tact displayed by Mr. Stewart at length brought 
him their reward.&nbsp; In 1828, he found his little room too small for his
trade.&nbsp; He leased a small store, thirty feet deep, on Broadway, 
between Chambers and Warren streets.&nbsp; Here he remained four years, his
trade increasing rapidly all the while.&nbsp; In 1832, he removed to a 
two-story building in Broadway, between Murray and Warren streets, and in a
short time was obliged by the growth of his business to add twenty feet to 
the depth of his store, and to put an additional story on the 
building.&nbsp; A year or two later he added a fourth story, and in 1837 a 
fifth story, so rapidly did he prosper.&nbsp; He had now a large and 
fashionable trade, had fairly surmounted all his early <!-- page 466--><a 
name="page466"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 466</span>difficulties, and had
laid the foundation of the immense fortune he has since acquired.</p>
<p>The great commercial crisis of 1837 was not unexpected by him.&nbsp; It 
had always been his habit to watch the market closely, in order to profit 
by any sudden change in it, and his keen sagacity enabled him to foresee 
the approach of the storm and to prepare for it.&nbsp; He marked his goods 
down at an early day and began to &ldquo;sell for cost,&rdquo; conducting 
his operations on a strictly cash basis.&nbsp; The prices were very low, 
the goods of the best quality, and he found no difficulty in obtaining 
purchasers.&nbsp; People were glad to save money by availing themselves of 
his low prices.&nbsp; In the midst of the most terrible crisis the country 
had ever seen, when old and established houses were breaking all around 
him, he was carrying on a thriving business.&nbsp; His cash sales averaged 
five thousand dollars per day.&nbsp; Other houses, to save themselves, were
obliged to sell their goods at auction.&nbsp; Thither went Stewart 
regularly.&nbsp; He bought these goods for cash, and sold them over his 
counters at an average profit of forty per cent.&nbsp; On a lot of silks 
for which he paid fifty thousand dollars he cleared twenty thousand dollars
in a few days.&nbsp; He came out of the crisis a rich man and the leading 
dry-goods dealer of New York.</p>
<p>A few years later he purchased the property lying on the east side of 
Broadway, between Chambers and Reade streets, on which he built a 
magnificent marble store.&nbsp; He moved into it in 1846.&nbsp; His friends
declared that he had made a mistake in erecting such a costly edifice, and 
that he had located it on the wrong side of Broadway.&nbsp; Besides, he was
too far up town.&nbsp; He listened to them patiently, and told them that in
a short time they would see his new store the centre of the fashionable 
retail trade of the city.&nbsp; His prediction was speedily fulfilled.</p>
<p>A few years ago, finding that the retail trade was deserting its old 
haunts, below Canal street, and going up town, be began the erection of his
present retail store, into which he moved as soon as it was completed, 
retaining his lower store for his wholesale business.</p>
<p>During the war, he made large profits from his sales to the <!-- page 
467--><a name="page467"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 467</span>Government, 
though he exhibited genuine patriotism in these dealings by charging only 
the most liberal prices for his goods.&nbsp; The gains thus realized by him
more than counterbalanced the losses he sustained by the sudden cessation 
of his trade with the South.</p>
<p>Fifty-four years have now elapsed since he first set foot in New York, 
poor and unknown, and to-day Mr. Stewart is the possessor of a fortune 
variously estimated at from thirty to fifty millions of dollars, and which 
is growing larger every year.&nbsp; The greater portion of his wealth is 
invested in real estate.&nbsp; He owns his two stores, the Metropolitan 
Hotel, and the Globe Theatre, on Broadway, and nearly all of Bleecker 
street from Broadway to Depau Row, several churches, and other valuable 
property.&nbsp; He owns more real estate than any man in America except 
William B. Astor, and is the most successful merchant in the world.&nbsp; 
He has acquired all this by his own unaided efforts, and without ever 
tarnishing his good name by one single dishonest act.&nbsp; Any man may be 
proud of such a record.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart is one of the hardest workers in his vast 
establishment.&nbsp; Though he has partners to assist him, he keeps the 
whole of his extensive operations well in hand, and is really the directing
power of them.&nbsp; He goes to his business between nine and ten in the 
morning, and works until five, and is never absent from his post unless 
compelled to be away.</p>
<p>His time is valuable, and he is not willing to waste it; therefore 
access to him is difficult.&nbsp; Many persons endeavor to see him merely 
to gratify their impertinent curiosity, and others wish to 
&ldquo;interview&rdquo; him for purposes which simply consume his 
time.&nbsp; To protect himself, he has been compelled to resort to the 
following expedient: A gentleman is kept on guard near the main door of the
store, whose duty it is to inquire the business of visitors.&nbsp; If the 
visitor replies that his business is private, he is told that Mr. Stewart 
has no private business.&nbsp; If he states his business to the 
satisfaction of the &ldquo;sentinel,&rdquo; he is allowed to go up stairs, 
where he is met by the confidential agent of the great merchant, to whom he
must repeat the object of his visit.&nbsp; If this gentleman is satisfied, 
or cannot get rid of <!-- page 468--><a name="page468"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 468</span>the visitor, he enters the private office of 
his employer, and lays the case before him.&nbsp; If the business of the 
visitor is urgent, he is admitted, otherwise an interview is denied 
him.&nbsp; If admitted, the interview is brief and to the point.&nbsp; 
There is no time lost.&nbsp; Matters are dispatched with a method and 
promptitude which astonish strangers.&nbsp; If the visitor attempts to draw
the merchant into a conversation, or indulges in complimentary phrases, 
after his business is arranged, Mr. Stewart&rsquo;s manner instantly 
becomes cold and repelling, and troublesome persons are not unfrequently 
given a hint to leave the room.&nbsp; This is his working time, and he 
cannot afford to waste it.&nbsp; In social life, he is said to be a 
cultivated and agreeable man.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart resides in a handsome brown stone mansion at the northeast 
corner of Fifth avenue and Thirty-fourth street.&nbsp; Immediately across 
the avenue, he has erected a residence of white marble, the handsomest and 
costliest dwelling in the Union, and one of the handsomest private 
residences in the world.&nbsp; It is said to have cost upwards of two 
millions of dollars.&nbsp; &ldquo;The marble work, which forms the most 
distinguishing characteristic of this palatial abode, receives its entire 
shape and finish in the basement and first floor of the building.&nbsp; The
fluted columns (purely Corinthian, and with capitals elaborately and 
delicately carved), which are the most striking feature of the main hall, 
are alone worth between three thousand five hundred and four thousand 
dollars each.&nbsp; On the right of this noble passage, as you proceed 
north from the side entrance, are, the reception and drawing rooms, and the
breakfast and dining rooms, all with marble finish, and with open doors, 
affording space for as splendid a promenade or ball as could be furnished 
probably by any private residence in Europe.&nbsp; To the left of the grand
hall are the marble staircase and the picture-gallery&mdash;the latter 
about seventy-two by thirty-six feet, lofty and elegant, and singularly 
well designed.&nbsp; The sleeping apartments above are executed upon a 
scale equally luxurious and regardless of expense.&nbsp; Externally, the 
building must ever remain a monument of the splendor which, as far as 
opulence is concerned, places some of our merchants on a footing almost 
with royalty <!-- page 469--><a name="page469"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
469</span>itself, and a glance at the interior will be a privilege eagerly 
sought by the visiting stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart is not generally regarded as a liberal man in the 
metropolis, probably because he refuses to give indiscriminately to those 
who ask his assistance.&nbsp; Yet he has made munificent donations to 
objects which have enlisted his sympathy, and has on hand now several 
schemes for bettering the condition of the working classes, which will 
continue to exert a beneficent influence upon them long after he has passed
away.&nbsp; His friends&mdash;and he has many&mdash;speak of him as a very 
kind and liberal man, and seem much attached to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart is now seventy years old, but looks twenty years 
younger.&nbsp; He is of the medium height, has light brown hair and beard, 
which are closely trimmed.&nbsp; His features are sharp, well cut, his eye 
bright, and his general expression calm, thoughtful, and 
self-reliant.&nbsp; His manner is courteous to all, but reserved and cold 
except to his intimate friends.&nbsp; He dresses quietly in the style of 
the day, his habits are simple, and he shuns publicity.</p>

<h3>I.&nbsp; THE THEATRES.</h3>
<p>There are sixteen theatres in New York usually in full operation.&nbsp; 
Taking them in their order of location from south to north, they are the 
Stadt, the Bowery, Niblo&rsquo;s, Theatre Comique, the Olympic, Lina 
Edwin&rsquo;s, the Globe, Wallack&rsquo;s, Union Square, the Academy of 
Music, the Fourteenth Street, Booth&rsquo;s, the Grand Opera House, the 
Fifth Avenue, the St. James, and Wood&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They are open throughout the fall and winter season, are well 
patronized, and with one or two exceptions are successful in a pecuniary 
sense.&nbsp; There are usually from 50,000 to 100,000 strangers in the 
city, and the majority of these find the evenings dull without some 
amusement to enliven them.&nbsp; Many of them are persons who come for 
pleasure, and who regard the theatres as one of the most enjoyable of all 
the sights of the city; but a very large portion are merchants, who are 
wearied with buying stock, and who really need some pleasant relaxation 
after the fatigues of the day.&nbsp; To these must be added a large class 
of citizens who are fond of the drama, and who patronize the theatres 
liberally.&nbsp; All these, it is stated, expend upon the various 
amusements of the place about $30,000 per night; and of this sum the larger
part goes into the treasury of the theatres.&nbsp; The sum annually 
expended on amusements is said to be from $7,000,000 to $8,000,000.</p>
<p>The New York theatres richly deserve the liberal patronage <!-- page 
471--><a name="page471"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 471</span>they 
enjoy.&nbsp; In no other city are such establishments as elegant and 
commodious, and nowhere else in America are the companies as proficient in 
their art, or the plays as admirably put upon the stage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p471.jpg">
<img alt="BOOTH&rsquo;S THEATRE." src="images/p471.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The most beautiful theatre in the city is <i>Booth&rsquo;s</i>, at the 
southeast corner of the Sixth avenue and Twenty-third street.&nbsp; It was 
begun in the summer of 1867, and opened to the public in January, 
1869.&nbsp; It is in the Renaissance style of architecture, and stands 
seventy feet high from the sidewalk to the main cornice, crowning which is 
a Mansard roof of twenty-four feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;The theatre proper fronts 
one hundred and forty-nine feet on Twenty-third street, and is divided into
three parts, so combined as to form an almost perfect whole, with arched 
entrances at either extremity on the side, for the admission of the public,
and on the other for another entrance, and the use of actors and those 
employed in the house.&nbsp; There are three doors on the frontage, devised
for securing the most rapid egress of a crowded <!-- page 472--><a 
name="page472"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 472</span>audience in case of 
fire, and, in connection with other facilities, said to permit the building
to be vacated in five minutes.&nbsp; On either side of these main entrances
are broad and lofty windows; and above them, forming a part of the second 
story, are niches for statues surrounded by coupled columns resting on 
finely sculptured pedestals.&nbsp; The central or main niche is flanked on 
either side by quaintly contrived blank windows; and between the columns, 
at the depth of the recesses, are simple pilasters sustaining the elliptic 
arches, which serve to top and span the niches, the latter to be occupied 
by statues of the great creators and interpreters of the drama in every age
and country.&nbsp; The finest Concord granite, from the best quarries in 
New Hampshire, is the material used in the entire fa&ccedil;ade, as well as
in the Sixth avenue side.&nbsp; The glittering granite mass, exquisitely 
poised, adorned with rich and appropriate carving, statuary, columns, 
pilasters, and arches, and capped by the springing French roof, fringed 
with its shapely balustrades, offers an imposing and majestic aspect, and 
forms one of the architectural jewels of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In its internal arrangements the theatre is in keeping with its external
magnificence.&nbsp; Entering through a sumptuous vestibule, the visitor 
passes into the magnificent auditorium, which is, in itself, a rare 
specimen of decorative art.&nbsp; The seats are admirably arranged, each 
one commanding a view of the stage.&nbsp; They are luxuriously upholstered,
and harmonize with the rich carpets which cover the floor.&nbsp; Three 
elegant light galleries rise above the parquet.&nbsp; The walls and ceiling
are exquisitely frescoed, and ornamented with bas reliefs in plaster.&nbsp;
The proscenium is beautifully carved and frescoed, and is adorned with 
busts of the elder Booth and the proprietor of the theatre; and in the 
sides before the curtain are arranged six sumptuous private boxes.&nbsp; 
The curtain is an exquisite landscape.&nbsp; The decoration of the house is
not done in the rough scenic style so common in the theatres of the 
country, but is the perfection of frescoe painting, and will bear the 
closest inspection.&nbsp; It is impossible, even with a strong glass, to 
distinguish between some of the frescoes and the bas reliefs.&nbsp; The 
stage is very large, and <!-- page 473--><a name="page473"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 473</span>rises gradually from the footlights to the 
rear.&nbsp; The orchestra pen is sunk below the level of the stage, so that
the heads of the musicians do not interfere with the view of the 
audience.&nbsp; The dressing of the stage is novel.&nbsp; The side scenes, 
or wings, instead of being placed at right angles to the audience, as in 
most theatres, are so arranged that the scene appears to extend to the 
right and left as well as to the rear.&nbsp; In this way the spectator is 
saved the annoyance of often looking through the wings, a defect which in 
most theatres completely dispels the illusion of the play.&nbsp; The 
scenery here is not set by hand, but is moved by machinery, by means of 
immense hydraulic rams beneath the stage, and the changes are made with 
such regularity and precision that they have very much the effect of 
&ldquo;dissolving views.&rdquo;&nbsp; The scenes themselves are the work of
gifted and highly educated artists, and never degenerate into the rough 
daubs with which most playgoers are familiar.&nbsp; The building is 
fireproof, and is warmed and ventilated by machinery.&nbsp; The great 
central chandelier and the jets around the cornice of the auditorium are 
lighted by electricity.</p>
<p>The plays presented here are superbly put on the stage.&nbsp; The 
scenery is strictly accurate when meant to represent some historic 
locality, and is the finest to be found in America.&nbsp; Perhaps the 
grandest stage picture ever given to an audience was the graveyard scene in
&ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; which drama, in the winter of 1869-70, &ldquo;held 
the boards&rdquo; for over one hundred nights.&nbsp; The dresses, the 
equipments, and general &ldquo;make up&rdquo; of the actors are in keeping 
with the scenery.&nbsp; Even the minutest detail is carefully attended 
to.&nbsp; Nothing is so unimportant as to be overlooked in this 
establishment.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, the company is unworthy of the place and the fame
of the proprietor.&nbsp; Mr. Booth, himself, is the great attraction.&nbsp;
It is his custom to open the season with engagements of other distinguished
&ldquo;stars,&rdquo; and to follow them himself about the beginning of the 
winter, and to continue his performances until the spring, when he again 
gives way to others.&nbsp; When he is performing it is impossible to 
procure a seat after the rising of the curtain.</p>

<img alt="GRAND OPERA HOUSE." src="images/p474.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Grand Opera House is next to Booth&rsquo;s in beauty.&nbsp; It is 
much larger than that theatre.&nbsp; But for its unfortunate location, 
nearly a mile from Broadway, it would be one of the most successful 
establishments in the city.&nbsp; The theatre is divided into two 
buildings, one fronting on the Eighth avenue and Twenty-third street, and 
containing the offices and entrances, and the theatre proper, which is in 
the rear of the former.&nbsp; The former building is a magnificent 
structure of white marble, in the Italian style of architecture.&nbsp; It 
fronts 113 feet on Eighth avenue, and 98 feet on Twenty-third street.&nbsp;
It is adorned with statuary and carvings, and is far too handsome for the 
part of the city in which it is located.&nbsp; The greater portion of this 
<!-- page 475--><a name="page475"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
475</span>building is taken up with the offices of the Erie Railway 
Company.</p>
<p>The theatre proper is connected with the front building by means of a 
superb vestibule, into which open the doors of the auditorium.&nbsp; It is 
one of the most beautiful halls in America, and one of the pleasantest 
lounging places.&nbsp; The auditorium is finished in light blue, white, and
gold, and when lighted up is magnificent.&nbsp; Every appointment and 
decoration is tasteful and beautiful, and there are many persons who 
consider it the finest interior in America.&nbsp; The stage is large and 
convenient, and the scenery good.&nbsp; The performances are passable.</p>
<p>The house was built by Mr. Samuel N. Pike for an Opera House.&nbsp; It 
was not successful, and was sold by him to the late Colonel James Fisk, 
Jr., for $1,000,000, a slight advance upon its cost.</p>
<p>Wallack&rsquo;s Theatre, at the northeast corner of Broadway and 
Thirteenth street, is, <i>par eminence</i>, <i>the theatre</i> of New 
York.&nbsp; Its audiences are more exclusively composed of citizens than 
those of any other house.&nbsp; New Yorkers are proud of it, and on 
Thursday evenings, or the first night of some new play, the audience will 
consist almost entirely of city people.&nbsp; The theatre itself is very 
plain, and there are many things about it that might be bettered.&nbsp; In 
other respects it is unqualifiedly the best theatre in which the English 
language is spoken.&nbsp; It is devoted almost entirely to comedy, and the 
plays presented on its stage are always of a high character.&nbsp; The Star
system is not adopted here, but the company consists of the best and most 
carefully trained actors and actresses to be found here or in 
England.&nbsp; It is emphatically a company of gentlemen and ladies.&nbsp; 
At present it includes Lester Wallack, the proprietor, John Brougham, 
Charles Mathews, John Gilbert, Charles Fisher, and J. H. Stoddart, and Mrs.
Jennings, Miss Plessy Mordaunt, Miss Effie Germon, and Mrs. John 
Sefton.&nbsp; Mr. Wallack is very proud of his theatre, and with good 
reason.&nbsp; He has made it the best in the country, and a model for the 
best establishments in other cities.&nbsp; The greatest care is taken in 
the production of plays, and every detail is presented to the audience with
a degree of <!-- page 476--><a name="page476"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
476</span>perfection which other managers vainly strive to attain.&nbsp; 
The scenery is exquisite and natural, the dresses are perfect&mdash;the 
toilettes of the ladies being famed for their elegance, and the acting is 
true to nature.&nbsp; There is no ranting, no straining for effect 
here.&nbsp; The members of the company talk and act like men and women of 
the world, and faithfully &ldquo;hold the mirror up to nature.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is a common saying in New York that even a mean play will be a success 
at Wallack&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It will be so well put on the stage, and so 
perfectly performed by the company, that the most critical audience will be
disarmed.</p>
<p>The Fifth Avenue Theatre, on Twenty-fourth street, in the rear of the 
Fifth Avenue Hotel, is next to Wallack&rsquo;s in popular favor.&nbsp; It 
is very much such an establishment in the character and excellence of its 
performances.&nbsp; It possesses a first-class company of ladies and 
gentlemen, some of whom have achieved national reputations, and all of whom
are worthy of the highest praise.&nbsp; The theatre itself is a handsome 
marble edifice, not very large, but of very attractive appearance.&nbsp; 
The interior is bright and cheerful.&nbsp; The ceiling is finely frescoed, 
the walls are panelled with large plate-glass mirrors, and the general 
effect is very brilliant.&nbsp; The building was owned by the late Col. 
James Fisk, Jr.&nbsp; The manager is Mr. Augustin Daly, a well-known writer
of successful plays.&nbsp; To his literary gifts Mr. Daly adds a high order
of managerial talent, and it is to his efforts exclusively that the very 
marked success of the theatre is due.</p>
<p>The Academy of Music is, as its name indicates, the Opera House of New 
York.&nbsp; It is a gloomy-looking structure without, but possesses a 
magnificent auditorium, fitted up in the style of the European Opera 
Houses.&nbsp; Its decorations are in crimson and gold, and are magnificent 
and tasteful.&nbsp; It is the largest theatre in the city, and one of the 
largest in the world.&nbsp; It is opened occasionally during the winter for
operatic performances.&nbsp; The audiences to be seen here are always in 
full dress, and the toilettes of the ladies, to say nothing of the beauty 
of many of the fair ones, offer a great attraction to sight-seers.</p>
<p>Niblo&rsquo;s Theatre, or as it is generally called, 
&ldquo;Niblo&rsquo;s Garden,&rdquo; <!-- page 477--><a 
name="page477"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 477</span>is situated in the 
rear of the Metropolitan Hotel, with an entrance on Broadway.&nbsp; It is 
one of the largest and handsomest theatres in the city, and by far the 
coolest in warm weather.&nbsp; It is devoted principally to the spectacular
drama.&nbsp; It was here that the famous spectacle of the Black Crook was 
produced.&nbsp; Its revival is to take place before these pages are in 
print, and it will probably be continued throughout the remainder of the 
season.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p477.jpg">
<img alt="ACADEMY OF MUSIC." src="images/p477.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Olympic is a large, old-fashioned theatre, on Broadway, between 
Houston and Bleecker streets.&nbsp; It is devoted to pantomime, and is 
famous as the headquarters of the erratic genius who calls himself Humpty 
Dumpty.</p>
<p>The Old Bowery Theatre, situated on the thoroughfare from which it takes
its name, below Canal street, is the only old theatre left standing in the 
city.&nbsp; Three theatres have preceded it on this site, and all have been
destroyed by fire.&nbsp; Within the last few years, the interior of the 
present theatre has been greatly modernized.&nbsp; The plays presented here
are of a character peculiarly suited to that order of genius which despises
Shakspeare, and hopes to be one day capable of appreciating the Black <!-- 
page 478--><a name="page478"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
478</span>Crook.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blood and thunder dramas,&rdquo; they are 
called in the city.&nbsp; The titles are stunning&mdash;the plays 
themselves even more so.&nbsp; A writer in one of the current publications 
of the day gives the following truthful picture of a &ldquo;Saturday night 
at the Bowery:&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not loitered long at the entrance after the gas blazed up, 
when from up the street, and from down the street, and from across the 
street, there came little squads of dirty, ragged urchins&mdash;the true 
gamin of New York.&nbsp; These at once made a gymnasium of the stone 
steps&mdash;stood on their heads upon the <!-- page 479--><a 
name="page479"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 479</span>pavements or climbed,
like locusts, the neighboring lamp-posts; itching for mischief; poking fun 
furiously; they were the merriest gang of young dare-devils I have seen in 
a long day.&nbsp; It was not long before they were recruited by a fresh lot
of young &lsquo;sardines&rsquo; from somewhere else&mdash;then they went in
for more monkey-shines until the door should be unbarred.&nbsp; They seemed
to know each other very well, as if they were some young club of genial 
spirits that had been organized outside of the barriers of society for a 
long while.&nbsp; What funny habiliments they sported.&nbsp; It had never 
been my experience to see old clothes thrown upon young limbs so 
grotesquely.&nbsp; The coat that would have been a fit for a corpulent 
youth nearly buried a skinny form the height of your cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on the other hand, &lsquo;young dropsy&rsquo;s&rsquo; legs 
and arms were like links of dried &lsquo;bolonas&rsquo; in the garments 
which misfortune&rsquo;s raffle had drawn for him.&nbsp; Hats without 
rims&mdash;hats of fur, dreadfully plucked, with free ventilation for the 
scalp&mdash;caps with big tips like little porches of leather&mdash;caps 
without tips, or, if a tip still clung to it, it was by a single thread and
dangled on the wearer&rsquo;s cheek like the husk of a banana.&nbsp; The 
majority seemed to have a weakness for the costumes of the army and the 
navy.&nbsp; Where a domestic tailor had clipped the skirts of a long blue 
military coat he had spared the two buttons of the waist-band, and they 
rested on the bare heels like a set of veritable spurs.&nbsp; Shoes and 
boots (and remember it&rsquo;s a December night) are rather 
scarce&mdash;and those by which these savoyards could have sworn by grinned
fearfully with sets of naked toes.&nbsp; One &lsquo;young sport,&rsquo; he 
had seen scarcely ten such winters, rejoiced in a pair of odd-mated rubber 
over-shoes, about the dimensions of snow-shoes.&nbsp; They saluted him as 
&lsquo;Gums.&rsquo;&nbsp; A youngster, with a childish face and clear blue 
eyes, now shuffled upon the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O Lordy, here&rsquo;s Horace, jist see his get 
up.&rsquo;&nbsp; A shout of laughter went up, and Horace was swallowed in 
the ragged mob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Horace&rsquo; sported a big army cap like a huge blue 
extinguisher.&nbsp; He wrapped his wiry form in a cut-down, long-napped 
white beaver coat, the lapels of which were a foot square, and <!-- page 
480--><a name="page480"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 480</span>shingled his
ankles as if he stood between a couple of placards.&nbsp; I had seen the 
latest caricature on the philosopher of the <i>Tribune</i>, but this second
edition of H. G. swamped it.&nbsp; I knew that that young rogue had counted
upon the effect of his white coat, and he enjoyed his christening with a 
gleeful face and a sparkle in his blue eyes.&nbsp; O, for the pencil of a 
Beard or a Bellew, to portray those saucy pug-noses, those dirty and 
begrimed faces!&nbsp; Faces with bars of blacking, like the shadows of 
small gridirons&mdash;faces with woful bruised peepers&mdash;faces with 
fun-flashing eyes&mdash;faces of striplings, yet so old and 
haggard&mdash;faces full of evil and deceit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every mother&rsquo;s son of them had his fists anchored in his 
breeches pockets, and swaggered about, nudging each other&rsquo;s ribs with
their sharp little elbows.&nbsp; They were not many minutes together before
a battle took place.&nbsp; Some one had tripped &lsquo;Gums,&rsquo; and one
of his old shoes flew into the air.&nbsp; I think he of the white coat was 
the rascal, but being dubbed a philosopher, he did his best to look very 
wise, but a slap on the side of the ridge of his white collar upset his 
dignity, and &lsquo;Horace&rsquo; &lsquo;went in,&rsquo; and his bony fists
rattled away on the close-shaven pate of &lsquo;Gums.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doors are now unbarred, and this ragged &lsquo;pent up little
Utica&rsquo; rends itself, but not without much more scratching and much 
swearing.&nbsp; O, the cold-blooded oaths that rang from those young 
lips!&nbsp; As the passage to the pit is by a sort of cellar door, I lost 
sight of the young scamps as the last one pitched down its gloomy 
passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the human stream&mdash;in a whirlpool of 
fellow-beings&mdash;nudging their way to the boxes and the upper tiers, I 
now found myself.&nbsp; It was a terrible struggle; females screaming, were
eddied around and around until their very faces were in a wire cage of 
their own &lsquo;skeletons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look out for pickpockets,&rsquo; shouted a 
Metropolitan.&nbsp; Every body then tried to button his coat over his 
breast, and every body gave it up as a bad job.&nbsp; In at last, but with 
the heat of that exertion&mdash;the smell of the hot gas&mdash;the fetid 
breath of two thousand souls, not particular, many, as to the quality of 
their gin&mdash;what a sweltering bath follows!&nbsp; The usher sees a 
ticket <!-- page 481--><a name="page481"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
481</span>clutched before him, and a breathless individual saying wildly, 
&lsquo;Where?&rsquo;&nbsp; He points to a distant part of the house, and 
the way to it is through a sea of humanity.&nbsp; A sort of a Dead Sea, for
one can walk on it easier than he can dive through it.&nbsp; I shall never 
know how I got there at last; all I remember now are the low curses, the 
angry growls and a road over corns and bunions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prompter&rsquo;s bell tingles and then tingles again.&nbsp; 
The bearded Germans of the orchestra hush their music, and the big field of
green baize shoots to the cob-web arch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is the time to scan the scene&mdash;that teeming 
house&mdash;that instant when all faces are turned eagerly to the 
foot-lights, waiting breathlessly the first sound of the actor&rsquo;s 
voice.&nbsp; The restlessness of that tossing sea of humanity is at a dead 
calm now.&nbsp; Every nook and cranny is occupied&mdash;none too 
young&mdash;none too old to be there at the rise of the curtain.&nbsp; The 
suckling infant &lsquo;mewling and puking in its mother&rsquo;s 
arms.&rsquo;&nbsp; The youngster rubbing his sleepy eyes.&nbsp; The timid 
Miss, half frightened with the great mob and longing for the fairy world to
be created.&nbsp; Elder boys and elder sisters.&nbsp; Mothers, fathers, and
the wrinkled old grand-sire.&nbsp; Many of these men sit in their 
shirt-sleeves, sweating in the humid atmosphere.&nbsp; Women are giving 
suck to fat infants.&nbsp; Blue-shirted sailors encircle their black-eyed 
Susans, with brawny arms (they make no &lsquo;bones&rsquo; of showing their
honest love in this democratic temple of Thespis).&nbsp; Division street 
milliners, black-eyed, rosy-cheeked, and flashy dressed sit close to their 
jealous-eyed lovers.&nbsp; Little Jew boys, with glossy ringlets and beady 
black eyes, with teeth and noses like their fat mammas and 
avaricious-looking papas, are yawning everywhere.&nbsp; Then there is a 
great crowd of roughs, prentice boys and pale, German tailors&mdash;the 
latter with their legs uncrossed for a relaxation.&nbsp; Emaciated German 
and Italian barbers, you know them from their dirty linen, their 
clean-shaven cheeks and their locks redolent with bear&rsquo;s grease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through this mass, wandering from pit to gallery, go the 
red-shirted peanut-venders, and almost every jaw in the vast concern is 
crushing nut-shells.&nbsp; You fancy you hear it in the lulls of the play 
like a low unbroken growl.</p>
<p><!-- page 482--><a name="page482"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
482</span>&ldquo;In the boxes sit some very handsome females&mdash;rather 
loudly dressed,&mdash;but beauty will beam and flash from any setting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lean over the balcony, and behold in the depths below the famous 
pit, now crowded by that gang of little outlaws we parted with a short time
ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of old times&mdash;of a bygone age&mdash;is this 
institution.&nbsp; In no other theatre in the whole town is that choice 
spot yielded to the unwashed.&nbsp; But this is the &lsquo;Bowery,&rsquo; 
and those squally little spectators so busy scratching their close-mown 
polls, so vigorously pummeling each other, so unmercifully rattaned by 
despotic ushers&mdash;they are its best patrons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are they not, in their light, great critics, too?&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t they know when to laugh, when to blubber, and when to applaud, 
and don&rsquo;t they know when to <i>hiss</i>, though!&nbsp; What a 
<i>fiat</i> is their withering hiss!&nbsp; What poor actor dare brave 
it?&nbsp; It has gone deep, deep into many a poor player&rsquo;s heart and 
crushed him forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The royal road to a news-boy&rsquo;s heart is to rant in 
style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Versatile Eddy and vigorous Boniface are the lads, in our day, 
for the news-boys&rsquo; stamps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ranting is out of the female line, but Bowery actresses have a 
substitute for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the proper moment, they draw themselves up in a rigid statue, 
they flash their big eyes, they dash about wildly their dishevelled hair, 
with out-stretched arms and protruding chins they then shriek out, 
V-i-l-l-a-i-n!</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Fannie Herring! what a tumult you have stirred up in the 
roused pit!&nbsp; No help for it, my dear lady.&nbsp; See, there&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Horace,&rsquo; standing on his seat and swinging his big blue cap in
a cloud of other caps&mdash;encore! encore!&nbsp; And the pretty actress 
bows to the pit, and there is more joy in her heart from the yells of those
skinny little throats than from all the flowers that ladies and gents from 
above may pelt her with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bill of fare for an evening&rsquo;s entertainment at the Old 
Bowery is as long as your cane, and the last piece takes us far into the 
night&mdash;yet the big house sits it out, and the little ones sleep it 
out, and the tired actor well earns his pay.</p>
<p><!-- page 483--><a name="page483"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
483</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not criticise the acting&mdash;a great part of 
the community thinks it&rsquo;s beyond the pale of criticism&mdash;this 
peculiarity of tearing things to pieces, and tossing around 
&lsquo;supes&rsquo; promiscuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another thing, those little ungodly imps down there have a 
great appreciation of virtue and pathos.&nbsp; They dash their dirty fists 
into their peepers at the childish treble of a little Eva&mdash;and they 
cheer, O, so lustily, when Chastity sets her heavy foot upon the 
villain&rsquo;s heart and points her sharp sword at his rascal 
throat.&nbsp; They are very fickle in their bestowal of approbation, and 
their little fires die out or swell into a hot volcano according to the 
vehemence of the actor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wake me up when Kirby dies,&rsquo; 
said a veteran little denizen of the pit to his companions, and he laid 
down on the bench to snooze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mind yer eye, Porgie,&rsquo; said his companion, before 
Porgie had got a dozen winks.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think ther&rsquo;s somthen 
goen to bust now.&rsquo;&nbsp; Porgie&rsquo;s friend had a keen scent for 
sensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I came out, at the end of the performance, I again saw 
&lsquo;Horace.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had just rescued a &lsquo;butt&rsquo; from a
watery grave in the gutter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jeminy! don&rsquo;t chaps about 
town smoke &lsquo;em awful short now&rsquo;days!&rsquo; was the observation
of the young philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The theatre is almost the only amusement that the ragged newsboy 
has, apart from those of the senses.&nbsp; The Newsboys&rsquo; Lodging 
House, which has been the agent of so much good among this neglected class 
of our population, find the late hours of the theatre a serious obstacle to
their usefulness.&nbsp; It is safe to say that if the managers of the two 
Bowery Theatres would close at an earlier hour, say eleven o&rsquo;clock, 
they would prosper as greatly as at present, and the boys who patronize 
their establishments would be much better off in body and mind.&nbsp; An 
effort is about to be made to obtain this reform from the managers 
voluntarily&mdash;instead of seeking legislative aid.&nbsp; We are quite 
sure it will be for the interest of all to close the theatres 
early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stadt Theatre, just across the street from the Old Bowery, is 
exclusively a German establishment.&nbsp; It is a plain old-fashioned 
building, without and within, but is worth a fortune to its 
proprietors.&nbsp; The performances are given in the German <!-- page 
484--><a name="page484"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 484</span>language, 
and the company is usually good.&nbsp; The prices are high and the 
audiences are large.&nbsp; Occasionally a season of German opera is 
given.&nbsp; I doubt that a more appreciative audience is to be found than 
that which assembles within the walls of the Stadt on opera nights.&nbsp; 
They are to a man good judges and dear lovers of music, and their applause,
when it breaks forth, is a spontaneous outburst which shakes the house to 
its foundations.&nbsp; It is generously given, too, and must be 
particularly grateful to the performers.</p>
<p>It is said that the members of the dramatic profession and the various 
attach&eacute;s of the theatres number 5000 persons.&nbsp; They constitute 
a class, or rather a world of their own.&nbsp; We shall have more to say of
some portions of them in other chapters, and can only speak of them in a 
general way here.&nbsp; As a rule they are poor, and are compelled to work 
hard.&nbsp; Wallack&rsquo;s and a few other establishments pay good 
salaries and have many &ldquo;off nights,&rdquo; but of the majority of 
performers constant labor is required, at poor pay.&nbsp; It is said that 
Forrest and Booth have received as much as $500 per night, and that 
Jefferson and Owens are paid at very near the same rate.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;stars,&rdquo; however, can make their own terms, but the rank and 
file of the profession have to take what they can get.&nbsp; The pay of 
these ranges from $15 to $50 per week.&nbsp; Some of the leading ladies and
gentlemen receive from $100 to $200 per week, but these can be counted on 
the fingers of one hand.&nbsp; Considering the work, the pay is poor, for 
an actor&rsquo;s life requires an immense amount of study and preparation, 
and is terribly trying to the nervous system.&nbsp; At some of the theatres
three performances are sometimes given in a single day, the same members of
the company appearing each time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballet girls,&rdquo; says Olive Logan, &ldquo;get from $8 to $15 
per week; the prompter $25 to $30; the call boy $15; the property 
man&rsquo;s salary ranges from $15 to $30.&nbsp; Then there are men up in 
the rigging loft, who attend to the flies and the curtain wheel, and 
various assistants, at salaries of $20 and $10.&nbsp; There are from two to
three scene painters at salaries of from $60 to $100.&nbsp; The back door 
keeper has $10, and two women to clean the <!-- page 485--><a 
name="page485"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 485</span>theatre every day at 
$6 each.&nbsp; The orchestra consists of a leader, at $100, and from twelve
to sixteen musicians, whose salaries range from $30 to $18 a week.&nbsp; 
The gasman and fireman get from $6 to $25 a week; costumer or wardrobe 
keeper $20 to $40; dressers $5 to $6; ushers $4 to $6; doorkeepers $12; 
policeman $5; treasurer $25 to $40.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the most important positions in the establishment is the ticket 
clerk.&nbsp; The receipts of the house pass through his hands, and as a 
constant effort is made to pass off bad money in this way, it is necessary 
to have some one in this position who is a good judge of money.&nbsp; In 
some of the theatres a broker&rsquo;s clerk or bank clerk is employed in 
this capacity.</p>
<p>With the exception of Wallack&rsquo;s, the Fifth Avenue, and perhaps 
Booth&rsquo;s, the theatres generally change their companies every 
season.&nbsp; The houses named retain the favorites, and there are among 
these companies many whose loss would be loudly deplored by the 
theatre-going people of the city.&nbsp; Many of the best actors, having 
distinguished themselves here, assume the rank of stars, and play 
engagements throughout the States.&nbsp; A metropolitan reputation will 
carry them successfully over the whole Union.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; MINOR AMUSEMENTS.</h3>
<p>Next in popularity to the theatres are the performances of the Negro 
Minstrels.&nbsp; Some of these companies have permanent halls which they 
occupy during the winter.&nbsp; The summer and early autumn are spent in 
travelling through the country.&nbsp; The principal companies are 
Bryant&rsquo;s and the San Francisco Minstrels.</p>
<p>Dan Bryant is now the proprietor of a beautiful little theatre in 
Twenty-third street, just west of the Sixth avenue.&nbsp; It is one of the 
cosiest and most comfortable places in the city, and is usually filled with
an audience of city people of the better class.&nbsp; The music is good, 
the singing excellent, and the mirth unrestrained and hearty.&nbsp; Dan 
Bryant, himself one of the most <!-- page 486--><a name="page486"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 486</span>irresistibly humorous delineators of the 
&ldquo;burnt cork opera,&rdquo; has collected a band of genuine artists, 
and has fairly won his success.&nbsp; He has raised Negro Minstrelsy to the
dignity of a fashionable amusement, and has banished from it all that is 
coarse and offensive.&nbsp; Men worn out with business cares go there to 
laugh, and they do laugh most heartily.&nbsp; I think that even the king 
who &ldquo;never smiled again,&rdquo; would have been forced to hold his 
sides here.&nbsp; Families come by the score to laugh at the vagaries of 
the sable minstrels, and the mirth of the little folks is one of the 
heartiest and healthiest sounds to be heard in the great city.</p>
<p>Next in order are the concerts.&nbsp; These are well patronized when the
performers are well known.&nbsp; There are several fine halls used for 
concerts and lectures.&nbsp; The principal are Steinway Hall, in Fourteenth
street, and Irving Hall, in Irving Place.</p>
<p>Lectures also draw largely.&nbsp; The principal halls used for this 
purpose are Steinway Hall, and the Halls of the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian
Association and the Cooper Institute.</p>
<p>Last, but not least in the estimation of New Yorkers, is the 
Circus.&nbsp; This is a permanent entertainment during the fall and 
winter.&nbsp; The performances are given in a handsome iron building 
located on Fourteenth street, opposite Irving Place.&nbsp; The building is 
in the form of a circus tent, and is lighted with gas, and warmed by steam 
coils.&nbsp; The audiences are large, and consist to a great extent of 
children.&nbsp; The little folks are very fond of the sports of the ring, 
and are among Mr. Lent&rsquo;s best patrons.</p>
<h2><!-- page 487--><a name="page487"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
487</span>XXXVI.&nbsp; THE MARKETS.</h2>
<p>The principal markets of New York are the Fulton, Washington, Jefferson,
Catharine, Union, Clinton, Franklin, Centre, and Tompkins Markets.&nbsp; 
With the exception of Tompkins Market, they are, as far as the houses are 
concerned, unmitigated nuisances to the city.&nbsp; They are in the last 
stages of dilapidation, and from without present the most ungainly 
spectacles to be witnessed in New York.&nbsp; The streets around them are 
always dirty and crowded, and in the hot days of the summer the air is 
loaded with foul smells which arise from them.</p>
<p>Within, however, the scene is very different.&nbsp; The rickety old 
buildings are crammed to repletion with everything edible the season 
affords.&nbsp; In the summer the display of fruit is often 
magnificent.&nbsp; The products of every section of the Union are piled up 
here in the greatest profusion.&nbsp; The country for miles around the city
has been stripped of its choicest luxuries, and even the distant West, and 
the far-off South have sent their contributions to the bountiful 
store.&nbsp; Meats, fish, and fowl also abound, of every species and 
description.&nbsp; Indeed, one who has the means can purchase here almost 
everything the heart can desire.&nbsp; The demand is great, and the prices 
are high.&nbsp; The stock seems immense, but it disappears rapidly.&nbsp; 
Fruits command high prices in New York, but sell readily.&nbsp; The market 
is very rarely overstocked.&nbsp; The same may be said of vegetables.&nbsp;
Good vegetables are always in demand.&nbsp; Those who furnish pure, fresh 
vegetables and meats are sure of a prosperous trade, but the amount of 
tainted wares of this kind disposed of daily is surprising.&nbsp; Nothing 
is lost here.&nbsp; Everything finds a purchaser.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 488--><a name="page488"></a><span

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 489--><a name="page489"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
489</span>Two-thirds of the people of the city, to save time and trouble, 
deal with the &ldquo;corner groceries,&rdquo; and &ldquo;provision 
stores,&rdquo; and never see the markets, but still the number of persons 
patronizing these establishments is very large.&nbsp; The sales begin 
between four and five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; The first comers 
are the caterers for the hotels, the restaurants, the fashionable boarding 
houses and the mansions of the rich, and the proprietors of the aforesaid 
&ldquo;corner groceries&rdquo; and &ldquo;provision stores.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
These latter charge their own customers an advance of from twenty-five to 
fifty per cent. on the market rates.&nbsp; Prices are high at this hour, 
and the best the market affords is quickly disposed of.&nbsp; The hotels 
and restaurants leave standing orders with the dealers, but always send 
their caterers to see that these orders are faithfully executed.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Market-men have to be watched,&rdquo; say the caterers.</p>
<p>As the morning advances, prices decline.&nbsp; The dealers have reaped 
their harvest, and can afford to &ldquo;fall&rdquo; on what is left.&nbsp; 
Now come those whose means compel them to be content with indifferent 
fare.&nbsp; With them is seen a perfect torrent of boarding-house keepers, 
who are too smart to come when the prices are high and the articles good 
and fresh.&nbsp; Others, too, the dealers will tell you, are independently 
wealthy, some are said to be millionaires.&nbsp; They are niggardly as to 
their tables, though they make great show in other respects, and they will 
haggle over the last penny.&nbsp; Last of all, towards ten o&rsquo;clock, 
and later, come the poor, to purchase what is left.&nbsp; God help 
them!&nbsp; It is no wonder the death rate is large in this class.</p>
<p>The best known markets are the Fulton, at the end of Fulton street, on 
East River, and the Washington, at the western end of the same street, on 
North River.&nbsp; Almost anything can be found in the Fulton market.&nbsp;
There are all kinds of provisions here; eating stands abound; bar rooms are
located in the cellars; cheap finery is offered by the bushel in some of 
the stalls; books, newspapers, and periodicals are to be found in others, 
at prices lower than those of the regular stores; and ice creams, 
confections, and even hardware and dry goods are sold here.&nbsp; The 
oysters of this market have a worldwide reputation.&nbsp; <!-- page 
490--><a name="page490"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
490</span><i>Dorlan&rsquo;s</i> oyster house is the best known.&nbsp; It is
a plain, rough-looking room, but it is patronized by the best people in the
city, for nowhere else on the island are such delicious oysters to be 
had.&nbsp; Ladies in full street dress, young bloods in all their finery, 
statesmen, distinguished soldiers, those whom you will meet in the most 
exclusive drawing rooms of the avenue, come here to partake of the 
proprietor&rsquo;s splendid &ldquo;stews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is more than thirty years since Dorlan began business here, and he 
has amassed a handsome fortune.&nbsp; He has done so by providing the best 
oysters in the market.&nbsp; He is well known throughout the city, and is 
deservedly popular.&nbsp; He is conscientious, upright in the minutest 
particular, and gives his personal attention to every detail of his 
business.&nbsp; Although very wealthy, he may still be seen at his stand, 
in his shirt sleeves, as of old, superintending the operations of his 
establishment, and setting an excellent example to younger men who are 
seeking to rise in the world.</p>
<p>The Washington market is more of a wholesale than a retail 
establishment.&nbsp; Supplies of meat, fish, vegetables, etc., are usually 
sent to the wholesale dealers here, to be sold on commission.&nbsp; These 
dealers will frequently go into the country, and engage a truckman&rsquo;s 
entire crop of vegetables and fruits, and then retail them to city dealers 
at their own prices.</p>

491</span>XXXVII.&nbsp; THE CHURCHES.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE SACRED EDIFICES.</h3>
<p>In some respects New York may be called &ldquo;the City of 
Churches.&rdquo;&nbsp; It contains 430 Protestant churches and chapels, 
with &ldquo;sittings&rdquo; for nearly 400,000 persons.&nbsp; Exclusive of 
endowments, the church property of the Protestant denominations is 
estimated at over $30,000,000.&nbsp; The annual expenses of these churches 
make an aggregate of about $1,500,000, and they pay out in charities about 
$5,000,000 more.&nbsp; The Roman Catholics have forty churches, each with a
large and rapidly increasing congregation.&nbsp; Their church property is 
estimated at about $4,000,000, and their other property used for religious 
and educational purposes is exceedingly valuable.&nbsp; The Greek Church 
has one congregation, now worshipping in a temporary chapel.&nbsp; The Jews
have twenty-seven synagogues, some of which are very handsome.&nbsp; In 
all, there are nearly 500 edifices in New York used for the public worship 
of God.</p>
<p>The first churches built in the city were those of the Dutch.&nbsp; 
Their church records are uninterrupted as far back as the year 1639.&nbsp; 
Their successors are now known as the Reformed Dutch, and are now in 
possession of twenty-five churches and chapels in the city.&nbsp; Some of 
these are very handsome.&nbsp; The new Collegiate Church, at the northwest 
corner of the Fifth avenue and Forty-eighth street, is to be built of brown
stone, with light stone trimmings.&nbsp; It is nearly completed, and when 
finished will be one of the most massive and imposing church edifices in 
America.</p>
<p><!-- page 492--><a name="page492"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
492</span>The Protestant Episcopal Church was introduced into the city at 
the advent of the English.&nbsp; The conquerors seized and appropriated to 
their own use the old Dutch Church in the fort, and introduced the service 
of the Church of England, which was continued there until the completion of
the first Trinity Church in 1697.&nbsp; This denomination now possesses 
ninety-four churches and chapels in the city, and a number of benevolent 
and charitable institutions.&nbsp; Its churches outnumber those of any 
other denomination, and its membership is the wealthiest.&nbsp; The General
Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church is located in New 
York.&nbsp; Trinity, mentioned elsewhere in this work, is the principal 
church.&nbsp; Grace, St. Thomas&rsquo;s, St. George&rsquo;s, Ascension, 
Calvary, the new St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s, St. John&rsquo;s, Trinity Chapel,
St. Paul&rsquo;s, St. Peter&rsquo;s, the Transfiguration, and the Heavenly 
Rest, are among the most beautiful in the city.</p>
<p>The Lutherans were the third in the order of their appearance in New 
York.&nbsp; They were to be found here before the capture of the city by 
the English, but their first church was not erected until 1702.&nbsp; It 
was a small stone edifice, and was located at the corner of Broadway and 
Rector street.&nbsp; They have now fifteen flourishing churches, and are 
very strong in members and wealth.</p>
<p>The Presbyterians now constitute one of the largest and most flourishing
denominations of the city.&nbsp; Owing to the intolerance of the 
Established Church and the Civil Government, they had considerable 
difficulty in introducing their faith here.&nbsp; They at first met in 
private houses.&nbsp; In 1707, one of their ministers was heavily fined, 
and condemned to pay the costs of the suit for preaching and baptizing a 
child in a private house.&nbsp; In 1716 they organized their first society,
and connected it with the Philadelphia Presbytery.&nbsp; The city 
authorities now granted them toleration, and allowed them to worship in the
City Hall until 1719.&nbsp; In the latter year they opened their first 
church in Wall street, near Broadway.&nbsp; The Presbyterian churches and 
mission chapels of New York are now as follows: Presbyterian proper, 70; 
United Presbyterian, 8; Reformed <!-- page 493--><a 
name="page493"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 493</span>Presbyterian, 7; 
Congregationalists, 9; making a total of 94.&nbsp; The denomination is 
extremely wealthy, and many of its churches are noted for their beauty and 
magnificence.&nbsp; The Presbyterians also support a number of noble 
benevolent and charitable enterprises.</p>
<p>The Baptists, like the Presbyterians, had considerable difficulty in 
establishing themselves here.&nbsp; In 1709, a Baptist minister was 
sentenced to three months&rsquo; imprisonment for preaching in New York 
without the permission of the city authorities.&nbsp; For some time the 
Baptists were subjected to considerable hostility, and were often obliged 
to immerse their proselytes by night to avoid interruption.&nbsp; Their 
first church was erected on Golden Hill, now known as Gold street, about 
1725.&nbsp; The various branches of this denomination have now about fifty 
churches and chapels in the city.&nbsp; The First and the Fifth Avenue 
Churches are among the wealthiest corporations in the city, and their 
sacred edifices are noted for their beauty and elegance.</p>
<p>The Methodists appeared here soon after their church had become strong 
in Great Britain.&nbsp; In 1766, Philip Embury, an Irishman, and a local 
preacher in the Wesleyan Church, began to hold religious services in his 
own house, in Barrack Row, now Park Place, to a congregation of half a 
dozen persons.&nbsp; The church growing greatly in numbers, a large room 
was rented for public worship on what is now William street, between Fulton
and John streets, and was used by them until the completion of their first 
church in John street, in 1768.&nbsp; The Methodists now have sixty 
churches and chapels in the city.&nbsp; They claim a membership of 13,000, 
and estimate the value of their church property at over $2,000,000.&nbsp; 
Some of their churches are very handsome.&nbsp; St. Paul&rsquo;s, at the 
northeast corner of Fourth avenue and Twenty-second street, is a beautiful 
structure.&nbsp; It is built of white marble, in the Romanesque 
style.&nbsp; The Rectory, adjoining it, is of the same material.&nbsp; It 
is the gift of Daniel Drew to the congregation.&nbsp; The spire is 210 feet
high, and the church will seat 1300 persons.</p>
<p>The Jews are said to have come into New York with its <!-- page 494--><a
name="page494"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 494</span>early settlers, and 
there seems to be good authority for this statement.&nbsp; Finding 
tolerance and protection here, they have increased and multiplied rapidly, 
and are now very numerous.&nbsp; They are immensely wealthy as a class, and
make a liberal provision for the unfortunate of their own creed.&nbsp; They
have twenty-seven synagogues, several of which are among the most prominent
buildings in the city.&nbsp; The Temple Emanuel, Fifth avenue and 
Forty-third street, is one of the costliest and most beautiful religious 
edifices in America.&nbsp; It is built of a light colored stone, with an 
elaborately carved front, and from the north and south ends rise slender 
and graceful towers, which give an air of lightness to the whole 
structure.&nbsp; The Temple is said to have cost, including the site, about
one million of dollars.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholics are, in point of numbers, one of the strongest, if 
not the strongest denomination in the city.&nbsp; In the early history of 
the colony a law was enacted which required that every Roman Catholic 
priest who should come into the city of his own free will, should be hanged
forthwith.&nbsp; This barbarous statute was never put in force, and one 
cannot help smiling to think how times have changed since then for the 
people of the Roman faith.&nbsp; Their first church occupied the site of 
the present St. Peter&rsquo;s, in Barclay street, and was built in 
1786.&nbsp; In 1815, they were strong enough to erect St. Patrick&rsquo;s 
Cathedral, on the corner of Mott and Prince streets.&nbsp; They have now 
forty churches in the city, and own a vast amount of real estate.&nbsp; The
city authorities, being frequently of this faith, have made liberal grants 
to their church, and in this way have excited no little hostility on the 
part of the Protestant churches, who are, as a rule, opposed to secular 
grants to religious denominations.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholics of New York consist principally of the poorer 
classes, though the church contains a large body of cultivated and wealthy 
people.&nbsp; Still its strength is among the poor.&nbsp; Consequently the 
majority of its churches are located in the meaner quarters of the city, so
that they may be convenient to those to whose spiritual wants they 
minister.&nbsp; The attendance upon these churches is immense.&nbsp; The 
pastor of a church in the <!-- page 495--><a name="page495"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 495</span>Fourth Ward once said to the writer that he 
had 25,000 persons of all ages and both sexes under his pastoral care, and 
that nearly all of them were very poor.&nbsp; His labors were arduous, and 
they were well performed.</p>
<p>Some of the Roman Catholic churches, on the other hand, are located in 
the most desirable portions of the city, and are extremely handsome within,
even if plain without.&nbsp; St. Stephen&rsquo;s, on Twenty-eighth street, 
between Third and Lexington avenues, is an unattractive brick structure 
extending through to Twenty-ninth street.&nbsp; The interior is very large 
and very beautiful.&nbsp; The altar is of pure white marble, and its 
adornments are of the richest description.&nbsp; The church is decorated 
with a series of excellent fresco paintings of a devotional 
character.&nbsp; The altar piece, representing The Crucifixion, is a 
magnificent work.&nbsp; The music is perhaps the best in the city.&nbsp; 
The church will seat nearly 4000 people, and is usually crowded.</p>
<p>The new St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, now in course of erection, will 
be the most elaborate church edifice in the Union.&nbsp; It covers the 
entire block bounded by Fifth and Madison avenues, and Fiftieth and 
Fifty-first streets, fronting on Fifth avenue.&nbsp; The corner stone was 
laid by Archbishop Hughes in 1858, and the work has been in progress, with 
some interruptions, ever since.&nbsp; Archbishop McCloskey has for several 
years past been pushing the work forward with steadfastness, and it is 
believed that a few years more will witness its completion.</p>
<p>The site of the church is very fine.&nbsp; It is the most elevated spot 
on Fifth avenue.&nbsp; The length of the building will be 332 feet; breadth
of the nave and choir, 132 feet; breadth at the transepts, 174 feet.&nbsp; 
The foundations rest upon a stratum of solid rock.&nbsp; The first course 
is of Maine granite, the material used in the Treasury Building at 
Washington.&nbsp; The upper portions of this course are neatly dressed with
the chisel.&nbsp; The remainder of the church is to be constructed of white
marble, from the Pleasantville quarries, in Westchester county.&nbsp; The 
crystalline character of this stone produces very beautiful effects in 
those portions which are most elaborately worked.&nbsp; The style of the 
edifice is the &ldquo;decorated Gothic,&rdquo; which was most <!-- page 
496--><a name="page496"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 496</span>popular in 
Europe between the ninth and fifteenth centuries.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p496.jpg">
<img alt="THE NEW ST. PATRICK&rsquo;S CATHEDRAL." src="images/p496.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The design would seem to be modelled after the famous Cathedral of 
Cologne, the most beautiful specimen of this order of architecture.&nbsp; 
The Fifth avenue front will be exceedingly beautiful.&nbsp; The carvings 
and statuary for its ornament are genuine works of art, and this portion of
the building will be equal to anything in the world.&nbsp; The central 
gable will be 156 <!-- page 497--><a name="page497"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 497</span>feet high.&nbsp; On each side of it will rise 
towers which are to reach a height of 328 feet from the ground, counting 
from the summit of the cross on each.&nbsp; These towers are to be square 
in form to a point 136 feet above the ground.&nbsp; They are then to rise 
in octagonal lanterns 54 feet high, above which are to soar magnificent 
spires to a further elevation of 138 feet.&nbsp; The towers and spires are 
to be adorned with buttresses, niches filled with statues, and pinnacles, 
which will have the effect of concealing the change from the square to the 
octagon.&nbsp; The cost of the church is estimated at over two millions of 
dollars.</p>
<p>The Unitarians made their appearance in the city in 1819, and have now 
five churches.&nbsp; One of these, the Church of the Messiah, Park avenue 
and Thirty-fourth street, is very handsome.</p>
<p>The Friends, or Quakers, opened their first meeting-house in 1703, and 
now have five places of worship, and own considerable property in the 
city.</p>
<p>All the denominations are actively engaged in missionary work.&nbsp; 
They have mission houses and chapels and schools in the worst quarters of 
the city, which are doing a noble work, and support them liberally.</p>
<p>The majority of the city churches are above Canal street.&nbsp; In some 
localities, especially on the fashionable streets, they crowd each other 
too greatly.&nbsp; A few are very wealthy, but the majority are compelled 
to struggle to get along.&nbsp; Pew rent is very high in New York, and only
persons in good circumstances can have pews in a thriving church.&nbsp; In 
a fashionable church large sums are paid for pews.</p>
<p>The New Yorkers can hardly be said to be a church-going people.&nbsp; 
The morning services are usually well attended, but the afternoon and 
evening services show a &ldquo;beggarly array of empty 
benches.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is astonishing to see the widespread carelessness 
which prevails here on the subject of church-going.&nbsp; There are 
thousands of respectable people in the great city who never see the inside 
of a church, unless drawn there by some special attraction.&nbsp; The 
support of the churches, therefore, falls on comparatively a few.&nbsp; 
These give liberally, and it may be <!-- page 498--><a 
name="page498"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 498</span>doubted whether any 
other band of Christians are more munificent in their offerings.</p>
<p>The distinctions which govern the world prevail in the city 
churches.&nbsp; Fashion and wealth rule here with an iron hand.&nbsp; The 
fashionable churches, with the exception of Grace Church, are now located 
high up town.&nbsp; They are large and handsome, and the congregations are 
wealthy and exclusive.&nbsp; Forms are rigidly insisted upon, and the 
reputation of the church for exclusiveness is so well known that those in 
the humbler walks of life shrink from entering its doors.&nbsp; They feel 
that they would not be welcome, that the congregation would consider them 
hardly fit to address their prayers to the Great White Throne from so 
exclusive a place.&nbsp; The widow&rsquo;s mite would cause the 
warden&rsquo;s face to wear a well-bred look of pitying amazement if laid 
in the midst of the crisp bank notes of the collection; and Lazarus would 
lie a long time at the doors of some of these churches, unless the police 
should remove him.</p>
<p>Riches and magnificence are seen on every side.&nbsp; The music is 
divine, and is rendered by a select choir of professional singers.&nbsp; 
The service is performed to perfection.&nbsp; The sermon is short and very 
pretty, and the congregation roll away in their carriages, or stroll along 
the avenue, well satisfied that they are in the &ldquo;narrow way,&rdquo; 
which the Master once declared to be so difficult to the feet of the rich 
man.&nbsp; But that was eighteen hundred years ago, and the world has grown
wiser in its own estimation.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; THE CLERGY.</h3>
<p>Talent, backed by experience and industry, will succeed in the long run 
in New York, but talent is not essential to success in the ministry 
here.&nbsp; We have often wondered what does make the success of some 
clergymen in this city.&nbsp; They have done well, and are popular, but 
they are not pulpit orators.&nbsp; In other cities a good pastor need not 
always be a good preacher.&nbsp; He may endear himself to his people in 
many different ways, so that <!-- page 499--><a name="page499"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 499</span>his other good qualities atone for his 
oratorical deficiencies.&nbsp; In New York, however, pastoral duties are 
almost entirely confined to the ministrations in the church, visitation of 
the sick, marriages, and attendance upon funerals.&nbsp; The city is so 
immense, the flock so widely scattered, that very few clergymen can visit 
all their people.&nbsp; The result is that pastoral visiting is but little 
practised here.&nbsp; The clergyman is generally &ldquo;at home&rdquo; to 
all who choose to call, on a certain evening in each week.&nbsp; A few 
civil, common-place words pass between the shepherd and the sheep, but that
is all.&nbsp; The mass of the people of this city are neglected by the 
clergy.&nbsp; Possibly the fault is with the people.&nbsp; Indeed, it is 
highly probable, considering the carelessness which New Yorkers manifest on
the subject of church going.&nbsp; During the summer months a large part of
New York is left to do without the Gospel.&nbsp; Very many of the churches 
are closed.&nbsp; The ministers are, many of them, delicate men, and they 
cannot bear the strain of an unbroken year of preaching.&nbsp; So they shut
up their churches during the warm season, go off to Long Branch, Saratoga, 
or the mountains, or cross the ocean.&nbsp; With the fall of the leaves, 
they come back to town by the score, and their churches are again opened 
&ldquo;for preaching.&rdquo;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be deceived by their robust 
appearance.&nbsp; It is only temporary.&nbsp; By the approach of the next 
summer they will grow thin and weak-voiced again, and nothing will restore 
them but a season at some fashionable resort, or a run over the ocean.</p>
<p>A man of real talent will always, if he has a church conveniently and 
fashionably located, draw a large congregation to hear him; but the 
location and prestige of the church often do more than the minister, for 
some of our poorer churches have men of genius in their pulpits, while some
of the wealthiest and most fashionable congregations are called on every 
Sunday to listen to the merest platitudes.</p>
<p>Let us not be misunderstood.&nbsp; There are able men in the New York 
pulpit&mdash;such men as Vinton, Hall, Chapin, Spring, Osgood, John Cotton 
Smith, Adams, and others&mdash;but we have some weak-headed brethren 
also.</p>
<p>A few clergymen grow rich in this city, the wealthy members <!-- page 
500--><a name="page500"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 500</span>of their 
flock no doubt aiding them.&nbsp; Some marry fortunes.&nbsp; As a general 
rule, however, they have no chance of saving any money.&nbsp; Salaries are 
large here, but expenses are in proportion; and it requires a large income 
for a minister to live respectably.&nbsp; One in charge of a prosperous 
congregation cannot maintain his social position, or uphold the dignity of 
his parish, on less than from eight to ten thousand dollars per annum, if 
he has even a moderate family.&nbsp; Very little, if any, of this will go 
in extravagance.&nbsp; Many clergymen are obliged to live here on smaller 
salaries, but they do it &ldquo;by the skin of their teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a rule, the clergymen of New York are like those of other 
places.&nbsp; Whether weak-headed, or strong-minded, they are, as a class, 
honest, God-fearing, self-denying men.&nbsp; There are, however, some black
sheep in the fold; but, let us thank Heaven, they are few, and all the more
conspicuous for that reason.</p>
<p>The speculative mania (in financial, not theological matters) invades 
even the ranks of the clergy, and there are several well-known gentlemen of
the cloth who operate boldly and skilfully in the stock markets through 
their brokers.&nbsp; One of these was once sharply rebuked by his broker 
for his unclerical conduct, and was advised, if he wished to carry on his 
speculations further, to go into the market himself, as the broker declined
to be any longer the representative of a man who was ashamed of his 
business.&nbsp; There are others still who are not ashamed to mingle openly
with the throng of curb-stone brokers, and carry on their operations behind
the sanctity of their white cravats.&nbsp; These last, however, may be 
termed &ldquo;Independents,&rdquo; as they have no standing in their 
churches, and are roundly censured by them.</p>
<p>Others there are who, on small salaries, support large families.&nbsp; 
These are the heroes of the profession, but the world knows little of their
heroism.&nbsp; With their slender means, they provide homes that are models
for all.&nbsp; They do their duty bravely, and with an amount of 
self-denial which is sometimes amazing.&nbsp; They have happy homes, too, 
even if it is hard to make both ends meet at the end of the year.&nbsp; 
They are often men of taste <!-- page 501--><a name="page501"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 501</span>and culture, to whom such trials are 
particularly hard.&nbsp; They carry their culture into their homes, and the
fruits of it blossom all around them.&nbsp; Wealth could not give them 
these pleasures, nor can poverty deprive them of them.&nbsp; They bring up 
their children in the fear and admonition of the Lord, and, thanks to the 
free schools and their own efforts, give them a good education.&nbsp; They 
send them out into the world well equipped for the battle of life, and reap
the reward of their efforts in the honorable and useful lives of those 
children.&nbsp; They go down into the grave without knowing any of the 
comforts of wealth, without having ever preached to a fashionable 
congregation, and the world comes at last to find that their places cannot 
easily be filled.&nbsp; Let us be sure &ldquo;their works do follow 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 502--><a name="page502"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
502</span>XXXVIII.&nbsp; BOARDING-HOUSE LIFE.</h2>
<p>New York is a vast boarding-house.&nbsp; Let him who doubts this 
assertion turn to the columns of the <i>Herald</i>, and there read its 
confirmation in the long columns of advertisements of &ldquo;Boarders 
wanted,&rdquo; which adorn that sheet.&nbsp; Or, better still, let him 
insert an advertisement in the aforesaid <i>Herald</i>, applying for board,
and he will find himself in receipt of a mail next morning that will tax 
the postman&rsquo;s utmost capacity.&nbsp; The boarding-houses of New York 
are a feature, and not the pleasantest one, of the great city.&nbsp; How 
many there are, is not known, but in some localities they cover both sides 
of the street for several blocks.&nbsp; Those which are termed fashionable,
and which imitate the expensiveness of the hotels without furnishing a 
tithe of their comforts, are located in the Fifth avenue, Broadway, and the
Fourth avenue, or near those streets.&nbsp; Some are showily furnished as 
to the public rooms, and are conducted in seemingly elegant style, but the 
proprietress, for it is generally a woman who is at the head of these 
establishments, pays for all this show by economizing in the table and 
other things essential to comfort.&nbsp; The really &ldquo;elegant 
establishments,&rdquo; where magnificence of display is combined with a 
good table and substantial comfort in other respects, may be almost named 
in a breath.</p>
<p>Whether fashionable or unfashionable, all boarding-houses are 
alike.&nbsp; They are supremely uncomfortable.&nbsp; The boarder is never 
really satisfied, and lives in a state of perpetual warfare with his 
landlady.&nbsp; The landlady, on her part, takes care that her guests shall
not be too comfortable.&nbsp; People generally become accustomed to this 
feverish mode of life; so accustomed to it indeed that they cannot exist 
without it.&nbsp; They find a sort of positive <!-- page 503--><a 
name="page503"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 503</span>pleasure in 
boarding-house quarrels, and would not be able to exist without the 
excitement of them.</p>
<p>The majority of boarders in the city are persons who have not the means 
to live in their own houses.&nbsp; Others there are, who fancy they have 
less trouble in boarding than in keeping their own establishments.&nbsp; 
This is a singular but common delusion, and its victims endure with what 
patience they can the wretched fare, the constant changes, and the 
uninterrupted inconvenience and strife of a boarding-house, and imagine all
the while that they are experiencing less trouble and annoyance than they 
would undergo in keeping house.&nbsp; The truth is, living is so expensive 
in New York, that all modes of life are troublesome to those who are not 
wealthy enough to disregard expense.&nbsp; But, here, as elsewhere, the 
privacy of one&rsquo;s own home is better than the publicity of a 
boarding-house, and a fuss with Bridget in one&rsquo;s own kitchen 
preferable to a row with a landlady, who may turn you out of doors at the 
very moment you are congratulating yourself that you are settled for the 
season.&nbsp; To persons with families, boarding-house life ought to be 
intolerable.&nbsp; Those who have children find that they cannot rear them 
as properly as they could within their own homes, that they cannot as 
surely shield them from unfavorable outside influences.&nbsp; Indeed, the 
troubles which these &ldquo;encumbrances&rdquo; cause are so great that the
wife and mother comes to the conclusion that more children will simply add 
to her difficulties of this kind, and so she commences to 
&ldquo;regulate&rdquo; her family, and the little ones cease coming.&nbsp; 
Some boarding-houses will not receive children at any price.&nbsp; Year by 
year the number of such establishments is increasing.&nbsp; What will be 
the result?&nbsp; The question is not hard to answer.</p>
<p>The boarding-house is generally a cast-off mansion of gentility.&nbsp; 
There are a score of things about it to remind you that it was once a home,
and to set you to speculating on the ways of the grim fate that has changed
it into a place of torment.&nbsp; Whole volumes have been written on the 
subject, and all agree that is simply what I have described it to be.&nbsp;
From the fashionable Fifth avenue establishment down to the cellar <!-- 
page 504--><a name="page504"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
504</span>lodging-houses of the Five Points, all boarding-houses are alike 
in this respect.&nbsp; Their success in tormenting their victims depends 
upon the susceptibility and refinement of feeling and taste on the part of 
the latter.</p>
<p>Landladies and boarders are mutually suspicious of each other.&nbsp; The
landlady constantly suspects her guest of a desire to escape from her 
clutches with unpaid bills.&nbsp; The latter is always on the look-out for 
some omission on the part of the hostess to comply with the letter of her 
contract.&nbsp; Landladies are frequently swindled by adventurers of both 
sexes, and guests most commonly find that the hostess does not comply very 
strictly with her bargain.&nbsp; Furthermore, the boarder has not only to 
endure his own troubles, but those of the landlady as well.&nbsp; Her 
sorrows are unending, and she pours them out to him at every 
opportunity.&nbsp; He dare not refuse to listen, for his experience teaches
him that his hostess will find a way to punish him for his unfeeling 
conduct.&nbsp; It is of no use to change his quarters, for he may fare 
worse in this respect at the next place.&nbsp; And so he submits, and grows
peevish and fretful, and even bald and gray over the woes of his 
tormentor.&nbsp; He consoles himself with one thought&mdash;in the next 
world landladies cease from troubling and boarding-houses do not exist.</p>
<p>All boarding-houses begin to fill up for the winter about the first of 
October.&nbsp; Few of the proprietors have any trouble in filling their 
establishments, as there is generally a rush of strangers to the city at 
that time.&nbsp; The majority of boarders change their quarters every fall,
if they do not do so oftener.&nbsp; At first, the table is well supplied 
with good fare, the attendance is excellent, and the proprietress as 
obliging as one can wish.&nbsp; This continues until the house is full, and
the guests have made arrangements which would render a removal 
inconvenient.&nbsp; Then a change comes over the establishment.&nbsp; The 
attendance becomes inferior.&nbsp; The landlady cannot afford to keep so 
many servants, and the best in the house are discharged.&nbsp; The fare 
becomes poor and scanty, and there begin to appear dishes upon which the 
landlady has exercised an amount of ingenuity which is astounding.&nbsp; 
They are fearfully <!-- page 505--><a name="page505"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 505</span>and wonderfully compounded, and it is best to 
ask no questions about them.&nbsp; The landlady keeps a keen watch over the
table at such times; and woe to him who slights or turns up his nose at 
these dishes.&nbsp; She is sorry Mr. X---&rsquo;s appetite is so delicate; 
but really her prices of board do not permit her to rival Delmonico or the 
Fifth Avenue Hotel in her table.&nbsp; Mr. P---, who was worth his 
millions, and who boarded with her for ten years, was very fond of that 
dish, and Mr. P--- was a regular <i>bon vivant</i>, if there ever was 
one.&nbsp; Hang your head, friend X---, mutter some incoherent excuse, gulp
down your fair share of the dish in question--and fast the next time it 
makes its appearance at the table.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p505.jpg">
<img alt="UNION SQUARE." src="images/p505.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The landlady has shrewdly calculated the chances of <!-- page 506--><a 
name="page506"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 506</span>retaining her 
boarders.&nbsp; She knows that few care to or can change in the middle of 
the season, when all the other houses are full; and that they will hang on 
to her establishment until the spring.&nbsp; If they do not come back the 
next fall, others will, and as the population is large, she can play the 
same game upon a fresh set of victims for many years to come.&nbsp; It is 
of no use to complain.&nbsp; She knows human nature better than you do, and
she adheres rigidly to her programme, grimly replying to your tale of woes,
that, if you do not like her establishment, you can go elsewhere.&nbsp; You
would go if you could find a better place; but you know they are all 
alike.&nbsp; So you make up your mind to endure your discomforts until May,
with her smiling face, calls you into the country.</p>
<p>Boarding-houses allow their guests a brief respite in the summer.&nbsp; 
The city is then comparatively deserted, and the most of these 
&ldquo;highly respectable&rdquo; establishments are very much in want of 
inmates.&nbsp; Expenses are heavy and receipts light then, and the 
landladies offer an unusual degree of comfort to those who will help them 
to tide over this dull season.</p>
<p>As regards the ferreting out of impropriety on the part of her guests, 
the New York landlady is unequalled by the most skilful detective in the 
city.&nbsp; She doubts the character of every woman beneath her roof; but 
in spite of her acuteness she is often deceived, and it may be safely 
asserted that the boarding-houses into which improper characters do not 
sometimes find their way are very few.&nbsp; It is simply impossible to 
keep them out.&nbsp; The average boarding-house contains a goodly number of
men who are so many objects of the designs of the adventurers.&nbsp; Again,
if the adventuress wishes to maintain the guise of respectability, she must
have a respectable home, and this the boarding-house affords her.&nbsp; One
is struck with the great number of handsome young widows who are to be 
found in these establishments.&nbsp; Sometimes they do not assume the 
character of a widow, but claim to be the wives of men absent in the 
distant Territories, or in Europe, and pretend to receive letters and 
remittances from them.&nbsp; The majority of these women are adventuresses,
and they make their living in a way they do not <!-- page 507--><a 
name="page507"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 507</span>care to have 
known.&nbsp; They conduct themselves with the utmost outward propriety in 
the house, and disarm even the suspicious landlady by their ladylike 
deportment.&nbsp; They are ripe for an intrigue with any man in the house, 
and as their object is simply to make money, they care little for an 
exposure if that object be attained.</p>
<h2><!-- page 508--><a name="page508"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
508</span>XXXIX.&nbsp; THE RESTAURANTS.</h2>
<p>New York is said to contain between five and six thousand 
restaurants.&nbsp; These are of every kind and description known to man, 
from Delmonico&rsquo;s down to the Fulton Market stands.&nbsp; A very large
number of persons live altogether at these places.&nbsp; They are those who
cannot afford the expense of a hotel, and who will not endure a 
boarding-house.&nbsp; They rent rooms in convenient or inconvenient 
locations, and take their meals at the restaurants.&nbsp; At many nominally
reputable establishments the fare is infamous, but as a rule New York is 
far ahead of any American city with respect to the character and 
capabilities of its eating-houses.</p>
<p>The better class restaurants lie along Broadway and Fifth avenue.&nbsp; 
The other longitudinal streets are well supplied with establishments of all
kinds, and in the Bowery are to be found houses in which the fare is 
prepared and served entirely in accordance with German ideas.&nbsp; In 
other parts of the city are to be found Italian, French, and Spanish 
restaurants, and English chop houses.</p>
<p>The fashionable restaurants lie chiefly above Fourteenth, and entirely 
above Canal street.&nbsp; Delmonico&rsquo;s, at the northeast corner of 
Fourteenth street and the Fifth avenue, is the best known.&nbsp; It is a 
very extensive establishment, is fitted up in elegant style, and is equal 
to any eating-house in the world.&nbsp; The prices are very high.&nbsp; A 
modest dinner, without wine, for two persons, will cost here from four to 
five dollars.&nbsp; The fare is good, however.&nbsp; The house enjoys a 
large custom, and every visitor to New York who can afford it, takes a meal
here before leaving the city.&nbsp; Delmonico is said to be very rich.</p>
<p><!-- page 509--><a name="page509"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
509</span>A young man, to whom the ways of the house were unknown, once 
took his sweetheart to lunch at this famous place.&nbsp; His purse was 
light, and when he came to scan the bill of fare, and note the large sums 
affixed to each item, his heart sank within him, and he waited in silent 
agony to hear his fair companion make her selection.&nbsp; After due 
consideration, she ordered a woodcock.&nbsp; Now woodcocks are expensive 
luxuries at Delmonico&rsquo;s, and the cost of one such bird represented 
more than the total contents of the lover&rsquo;s purse.&nbsp; He was in 
despair, but a lucky thought occurred to him.&nbsp; Turning to the lady, he
asked with an air of profound astonishment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can eat a whole woodcock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How large is it?&rdquo; asked the fair one, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About as large as a full grown turkey&rdquo; was the grave 
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I&rsquo;ll take an oyster stew,&rdquo; said the lady, 
quickly.</p>
<p>The fashionable restaurants make large profits on their sales.&nbsp; 
Their customers are chiefly ladies, and men who have nothing to do.&nbsp; 
Their busiest hours are the early afternoon, and during the evening.&nbsp; 
After the theatres are closed, they are thronged with parties of ladies and
gentlemen who come in for supper.</p>
<p>Some of the best restaurants in the city are those in which a lady is 
never seen.&nbsp; It must not be supposed that they are disreputable 
places.&nbsp; They are entirely the opposite.&nbsp; They are located in the
lower part of the city, often in some by-street of the heavy business 
section, and are patronized chiefly by merchants and clerks, who come here 
to get lunch and dinner.&nbsp; The fare is excellent, and the prices are 
reasonable.&nbsp; The eating houses of Henry Bode, in Water street, near 
Wall street, Rudolph in Broadway, near Courtlandt street, and Nash &amp; 
Fuller (late Crook, Fox &amp; Nash), in Park Row, are the best of this 
kind.&nbsp; In the last there is a department for ladies.</p>
<p>Between the hours of noon and three o&rsquo;clock, the down-town 
restaurants are generally crowded with a hungry throng.&nbsp; In some of 
them every seat at the long counters and at the tables is filled, and the 
floor is crowded with men standing and eating from plates which they hold 
in their hands.&nbsp; The noise, the <!-- page 510--><a 
name="page510"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 510</span>bustle, the clatter 
of knives and dishes, the slamming of doors, and the cries of the waiters 
as they shout out the orders of the guests, are deafening.&nbsp; The 
waiters move about with a celerity that is astonishing; food is served and 
eaten with a dispatch peculiar to these places.&nbsp; A constant stream of 
men is pouring out of the doors, and as steady a stream flowing in to take 
their places.&nbsp; At some of the largest of these establishments as many 
as fifteen hundred people are supplied with food during the course of the 
day.&nbsp; A well patronized restaurant is very profitable in New York, 
even if its prices are moderate, and the higher priced establishments make 
their proprietors rich in a comparatively short time.&nbsp; The proprietor 
of a Broadway oyster saloon made a fortune of $150,000 by his legitimate 
business in five years.&nbsp; A large part of the income of the restaurants
is derived from the sale of liquors at the bar.</p>
<p>The principal up-town restaurants are largely patronized by disreputable
people.&nbsp; Impure women go there to pick up custom, and men to find such
companions.&nbsp; Women whose social position is good, do not hesitate to 
meet their lovers at such places, for there is a great deal of truth in the
old adage which tells us that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no place so private as a
crowded hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; A quiet but close observer will frequently see a
nod, or a smile, or a meaning glance pass between the most respectable 
looking persons of opposite sexes, who are seemingly strangers to each 
other, and will sometimes see a note slyly sent by a waiter, or dropped 
adroitly into the hand of the woman as the man passes out, while her face 
wears the demurest and most rigidly virtuous expression.&nbsp; Such women 
frequent some of the best known up-town establishments to so great an 
extent that a lady entering one of them is apt to be insulted in this way 
by the male habitu&eacute;s of the place.&nbsp; These wretches hold all 
women to be alike, and act upon this belief.</p>
<h2><!-- page 511--><a name="page511"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
511</span>XL.&nbsp; THE CHEAP LODGING-HOUSES.</h2>
<p>The Bowery and the eastern section of the city are full of cheap 
lodging-houses, which are a grade lower than the lowest hotels, and several
grades above the cellars.&nbsp; One or two of these are immense 
establishments, five and six stories in height.&nbsp; Some of them provide 
their lodgers with beds and covering, others supply pallets laid down on 
the floor of a cheerless room, and others again give merely the pallets and
no sheets or coverings.&nbsp; The rooms, the beds, and the bedding in all 
these establishments are horribly dirty, and are badly ventilated.&nbsp; 
Bed bugs abound in the summer, and in the winter the lodger is nearly 
frozen, the covering, when furnished, being utterly inadequate to the task 
of keeping out the cold.&nbsp; From six to ten persons are put in a room 
together.&nbsp; The price varies from ten to twenty-five cents, according 
to the accommodations furnished.&nbsp; Each of these houses is provided 
with a bar, at which the vilest liquors are sold at ten cents a 
drink.&nbsp; The profits of the business are very great, not counting the 
receipts of the bar, which are in proportion.&nbsp; The expense of fitting 
up and conducting such an establishment is trifling.&nbsp; One of them 
accommodates nearly two hundred lodgers per night, which at ten cents per 
head, would be a net receipt of twenty dollars.</p>
<p>The persons who patronize these establishments are mainly vagrants, men 
who live from hand to mouth, and who will not be received by the humblest 
boarding-house.&nbsp; Some are doubtless unfortunate, but the majority are 
vagrants from choice.&nbsp; Some have irregular occupations, others get the
price of their lodgings by begging.</p>
<p>The business of a lodging-house seldom commences before <!-- page 
512--><a name="page512"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 512</span>ten 
o&rsquo;clock, and its greatest rush is just after the closing of the 
theatres; but all through the night, till three o&rsquo;clock in the 
morning, they are receiving such of the outcast population as can offer the
price of a bed.&nbsp; To any one interested in the misery of the city, the 
array presented on such an occasion is very striking.&nbsp; One sees every 
variety of character, runaway boys, truant apprentices, drunken mechanics, 
and broken-down mankind generally.&nbsp; Among these are men who have seen 
better days.&nbsp; They are decayed gentlemen who appear regularly in Wall 
street, and eke out the day by such petty business as they may get hold of;
and are lucky if they can make enough to carry them through the 
night.&nbsp; In all lodging-houses the rule holds good, &ldquo;First come, 
first served,&rdquo; and the last man in the room gets the worst 
spot.&nbsp; Each one sleeps with his clothes on, and his hat under his 
head, to keep it from being stolen.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock in the 
morning all oversleepers are awakened, and the rooms got ready for the 
coming night.&nbsp; No one is allowed to take anything away, and if the 
lodger has a parcel, he is required to leave it at the bar.&nbsp; This 
prevents the theft of bedclothes.</p>
<h2><!-- page 513--><a name="page513"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
513</span>XLI.&nbsp; THE LIBRARIES.</h2>
<p>The Libraries of New York are large and well patronized.&nbsp; The 
various collections, including those of the institutions of learning, 
number over 500,000 volumes.</p>
<p>The oldest collection is the &ldquo;Society Library,&rdquo; which is 
contained in a handsome brick edifice in University Place.&nbsp; In 1729, 
the Rev. John Wellington, Rector of Newington, in England, generously 
bequeathed his library, consisting of 1622 volumes, to the &ldquo;Society 
for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this 
was added a collection of books presented by the Rev. John Sharp, Chaplain 
to Lord Bellamont.&nbsp; The whole collection was sent to New York, and 
opened for public use in 1731, under the name of the &ldquo;Corporation 
Library.&rdquo;&nbsp; The death of the librarian occurred soon after, and 
the library was suffered to fall into disuse.&nbsp; In 1754, a number of 
citizens of means and literary taste, founded the &ldquo;Society 
Library,&rdquo; to which, with the consent of the city, they added the old 
&ldquo;Corporation Library.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1772, the Society received a 
charter from King George III.&nbsp; It is one of the wealthiest and most 
flourishing institutions in the city.&nbsp; The annual subscription is 
$10.&nbsp; The collection of books is very valuable and interesting, and 
comprises over 50,000 volumes.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Astor Library&rdquo; is the best known outside of the 
city.&nbsp; The library building is a massive structure of brick with brown
stone trimmings, situated in Lafayette Place, next door to the residence of
William B. Astor, Esq.&nbsp; It was founded by John Jacob Astor, and 
enlarged by his son William.&nbsp; The books are contained in two large and
elegant halls, occupying the entire building above the first floor.&nbsp; 
The collection numbers about <!-- page 514--><a name="page514"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 514</span>150,000 volumes, and was made by the late Dr. 
Coggeswell, the first Librarian, whose judgment, taste, and learning were 
highly appreciated by the elder Astor.&nbsp; The library is mainly one of 
reference, and is very complete in most of the subjects it comprises.&nbsp;
In the departments of science, history, biography, and philology, it is 
especially fine.&nbsp; It also contains many rare and valuable illustrated 
works, a number of original editions of the earliest books, and some 
valuable manuscripts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p514.jpg">
<img alt="LAFAYETTE PLACE." src="images/p514.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The collection is free to the public, and is open daily except on 
Sundays and holidays, and during the month of August, from 10 A.M. until 4 
P.M.&nbsp; The books cannot be taken from the reading-room, nor are 
visitors allowed to use pen and ink in making notes from them.&nbsp; It is 
said that the classes Mr. Astor desired most <!-- page 515--><a 
name="page515"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 515</span>to benefit by this 
library were the working people, who are unable to buy books of their 
own.&nbsp; If this be true, his wishes have been entirely defeated, as the 
hall is open only during the hours when it is impossible for working people
to attend.&nbsp; In the facilities which it affords to those who wish to 
use it, the Astor is very much behind the great libraries of Europe, or 
even the Public Library of Boston.</p>
<p>The most popular, and the most thoroughly representative library of the 
city, is the Mercantile Library, located in Clinton Hall, in Astor 
Place.&nbsp; It owns this building, and its property is valued at 
$500,000.&nbsp; It was founded in 1820, by William Wood, a native of 
Boston, and a gentleman eminent for his efforts in behalf of the spread of 
education and liberal ideas.&nbsp; It began as a subscription library with 
a collection of 700 volumes, and was located in a small room at No. 49 
Fulton street.&nbsp; The collection now numbers 120,000 volumes, and 
increases at the rate of 13,000 volumes a year.&nbsp; It is the fourth 
library in size in the Union.&nbsp; Those which are larger are the Library 
of Congress, the Public Library of Boston, and the Astor Library.&nbsp; The
library is the property of the clerks of New York, and though it does not 
compare with the Astor in the solidity or value of its contents, is a 
creditable monument to the good sense and taste of the young men of our 
mercantile community.&nbsp; No one but a clerk can hold an office in 
it.&nbsp; The term &ldquo;clerk&rdquo; is made to include all men who live 
on a salary.&nbsp; These members pay an initiation fee of $1, and an annual
subscription of $4.&nbsp; To all other persons the privileges of the 
library are offered at an annual subscription of $5.&nbsp; In April, 1870, 
the books of the institution showed a roll of 12,867 persons entitled to 
the use of the library and reading-room, the latter of which contains 400 
newspapers and periodicals.</p>
<p>A large part of the collection consists of works of fiction.&nbsp; It is
a lending library, and its books are sent to readers in Yonkers, Norwalk, 
Stamford, Elizabeth, and Jersey City, as well as in New York, in each of 
which it has branches.&nbsp; There are also branch offices in Yorkville and
in Cedar street.&nbsp; Every morning a canvass bag, containing the books 
returned and <!-- page 516--><a name="page516"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
516</span>applications for others wanted, is sent from each branch to the 
library, and is returned in the afternoon full.&nbsp; The directors offer 
to establish a branch in any of the suburban towns in which one hundred 
subscribers can be obtained in advance.&nbsp; The average daily delivery of
books is 760, of which about three-quarters are taken from the library 
proper, the rest from the branches.&nbsp; On Saturday evening the demand 
for books is very great.</p>
<p>The system of delivery is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each member on joining the library has a folio assigned him in 
the ledger, and its number is written on the ticket which is given him as a
certificate of membership.&nbsp; Let us suppose you have received one of 
these tickets, and have made your selection of the book you want.&nbsp; You
fill up a blank application card, with the name of the book desired.&nbsp; 
You hand that to one of the attendants.&nbsp; When he has found a book for 
you, he hands it, with your application card, to the delivery clerk.&nbsp; 
This gentleman occupies a large desk at the central counter, and has before
him two immense drawers, divided into partitions for the reception of the 
cards.&nbsp; Each member&rsquo;s name has a place in one or the other of 
these drawers, and the number of the folio shows where that place is.&nbsp;
The clerk instantly turns to your name, and finds the card you handed in 
when you last borrowed a book.&nbsp; If the date, stamped at the time of 
delivery, shows that you have kept it longer than the rules allow, he 
levies a small fine, and you must pay it before you can borrow again.&nbsp;
All formalities transacted, the old card is destroyed, the new one put in 
its place, and you are sent away in peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The system of checking books, as we have described it, enables 
the librarian to ascertain in a moment just what any particular member has 
borrowed; but it does not show what has become of any particular 
book.&nbsp; Many attempts have been made to devise a system of double 
accounts, so that a check could be kept upon the members and the books at 
the same time, but without success.&nbsp; A partial record book, however, 
is now kept.&nbsp; Whenever a standard book is borrowed, the delivery clerk
marks upon a little yellow ticket simply the folio number <!-- page 
517--><a name="page517"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 517</span>of the 
borrower.&nbsp; Every day the yellow tickets are examined, and if it 
appear, say, that folio 10,029 has had a book more than three weeks, the 
clerk turns to the drawer and finds out who folio 10,029 is, and what book 
is charged against him, and sends him a notice that his time is up.&nbsp; 
It is found impracticable to apply this system to novels, which form the 
greater part of the circulation of the library; but it is useful as far as 
it goes, and prevents the loss of many valuable books.</p>

<img alt="CLINTON HALL." src="images/p517.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of late years a postal order scheme has been perfected, and for 
convenience and simplicity it could hardly be improved.&nbsp; Its design is
to enable members to draw books without visiting the library.&nbsp; Blank 
forms are obtained from the Post-office Department, about the size and 
shape of a newspaper wrapper, bearing on one side a two-cent postage stamp,
and the printed address, &lsquo;Mercantile Library, Astor Place, 
City,&rsquo; and on the other a blank application, with a five-cent 
&lsquo;Mercantile Library delivery stamp,&rsquo; and some printed 
directions.&nbsp; You fill up the application in the usual way, fold the 
wrapper like a note (it is already gummed), and drop it in the nearest 
Post-office box.&nbsp; In a few hours at furthest a messenger brings to 
your house the book you <!-- page 518--><a name="page518"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 518</span>have asked for, and takes away the volume you 
want to return.&nbsp; The system is fast increasing in popularity.&nbsp; A 
horse and wagon are constantly employed in the collection and delivery, and
the number of volumes sent out in this way is about 12,000 annually.&nbsp; 
The delivery blanks are sold at the rate of seven cents each&mdash;two 
cents representing the postage and five the cost of the 
delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other collections are the Library of the New York Historical 
Society, embracing over 30,000 volumes, besides many interesting 
manuscripts, papers, coins and antiquities; the Apprentices&rsquo; Library,
18,000 volumes; the Library of the American Institute, 10,000 volumes; the 
City Library, 5000 volumes; the Law Institute Library, about 5000 volumes; 
the Library of the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association, about 15,000 
volumes; the Library of the Protestant Episcopal General Theological 
Seminary, 18,000 volumes; the Library of the Union Theological Seminary, 
26,000 volumes; the Library of the Cooper Institute; and the libraries of 
the various institutions of learning.</p>
<p>Mr. James Lenox, a wealthy and prominent citizen, is now erecting on the
Fifth avenue, near Seventieth street, and immediately opposite the Central 
Park, a massive building of granite, which is to be one of the most 
imposing structures in the City.&nbsp; In this, at its completion, he 
intends placing his magnificent collection of books and works of art, which
constitute the most superb private collection in America.&nbsp; The whole 
will be opened to the public under certain restrictions.</p>
<h2><!-- page 519--><a name="page519"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
519</span>XLII.&nbsp; PROFESSIONAL MEN.</h2>
<p>New York is full of professional men, that is, of men who earn their 
living by brain work.&nbsp; One class&mdash;the clergy&mdash;has already 
been mentioned.</p>
<p>The Bar is next in numbers.&nbsp; There are about three thousand lawyers
practising at the New York bar.&nbsp; A few of these have large incomes, 
two or three making as much as fifty thousand dollars per annum; but the 
average income of the majority is limited.&nbsp; An income of ten or 
fifteen thousand dollars is considered large in the profession, and the 
number of those earning such a sum is small.</p>
<p>In most cities the members of the legal profession form a clique, and 
are very clannish.&nbsp; Each one knows everybody else, and if one member 
of the bar is assailed, the rest are prompt to defend him.&nbsp; In New 
York, however, there is no such thing as a legal 
&ldquo;fraternity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each man is wrapped in his own affairs, and
knows little and cares less about other members of the profession.&nbsp; We
have been surprised to find how little these men know about each 
other.&nbsp; Some have never even heard of others who are really prosperous
and talented.</p>
<p>The courts of the city are very numerous; and each man, in entering upon
his practice, makes a specialty of some one or more of them, and confines 
himself to them.&nbsp; His chances of success are better for doing this, 
than they would be by adopting a general practice.&nbsp; Indeed, it would 
be simply impossible for one man to practise in all.</p>
<p>Many of the best lawyers rarely go into the courts.&nbsp; They prefer 
chamber practice, and will not try a case in court if they can help 
it.&nbsp; The process in the courts is slow and vexatious, <!-- page 
520--><a name="page520"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 520</span>and consumes
too much of their time.&nbsp; Their chamber practice is profitable to them,
and beneficial to the community, as it prevents much tedious 
litigation.</p>
<p>Many lawyers with fair prospects and comfortable incomes, who are 
succeeding in their profession in other places, come to New York, expecting
to rise to fame and fortune more rapidly here.&nbsp; They are 
mistaken.&nbsp; The most accomplished city barrister finds success a slow 
and uncertain thing.&nbsp; It requires some unusually fortunate 
circumstance to introduce a new lawyer favorably to a New York public.</p>
<p>The profession in this city can boast some of the most eminent names in 
the legal world, such men as Charles O&rsquo;Connor, William M. Evarts, and
others of a similar reputation.</p>
<p>The Medical Profession is also well represented.&nbsp; It is said that 
there are about as many physicians and surgeons as lawyers practising in 
the city.&nbsp; New York offers a fine field for a man of genuine 
skill.&nbsp; Its hospitals and medical establishments are the best 
conducted of any in the country, and afford ample opportunity for study and
observation.&nbsp; The opportunity for studying human nature is all that 
one can desire.&nbsp; The most eminent medical men in the country either 
reside here or are constantly visiting the city.</p>
<p>Some of the city practitioners are very fortunate in a pecuniary 
sense.&nbsp; It is said that some of them receive very large sums every 
year.&nbsp; Dr. Willard Parker was once called out of town to see a 
patient, to whom he sent a bill of $300.&nbsp; The amount was objected to, 
and Dr. Parker proved by his books that his daily receipts were over that 
sum.&nbsp; He is said to be an exception to the general rule, however, 
which rule is that but very few of the best paid medical men receive over 
$20,000 per annum.&nbsp; Surgeons are paid much better than 
physicians.&nbsp; Dr. Carnochan is said to have received as much as $2000 
for a single operation.&nbsp; As a rule, however, the city physicians do 
little more than pay expenses, especially if they have families.&nbsp; From
$5000 to $10,000 is a good income, and a man of family has but little 
chance of saving out of this if he lives in any degree of comfort.</p>
<p><!-- page 521--><a name="page521"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
521</span>Literary men and women are even more numerous in the metropolis 
than lawyers or doctors.&nbsp; They are of all classes, from the great 
author of world-wide fame to the veriest scribbler.&nbsp; The supply is 
very largely in advance of the demand, and as a consequence, all have to 
exert themselves to get along.&nbsp; A writer in the <i>World</i> estimates
the annual receipts of New York authors at about one million of dollars, 
and the number of writers at 2000, which would give an average income to 
each of about $500.&nbsp; As a matter of course, it is impossible to make 
any reliable estimate, and there can be little doubt that the writer 
referred to has been too generous in his average.&nbsp; Authorship in New 
York offers few inducements of a pecuniary nature.&nbsp; Men of undoubted 
genius often narrowly escape starvation, and to make a bare living by the 
pen requires, in the majority of instances, an amount of mental and manual 
labor and application which in any mercantile pursuit would ensure a 
fortune.</p>
<h2><!-- page 522--><a name="page522"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
522</span>XLIII.&nbsp; PROFESSIONAL CRIMINALS.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE THIEVES.</h3>
<p>The criminal class of New York is very large, but it is not so large as 
is commonly supposed.&nbsp; In the spring of 1871, the Rev. Dr. Bellows 
stated that the City of New York contained 30,000 professional thieves, 
20,000 lewd women and harlots, 3000 rum shops, and 2000 gambling houses, 
and this statement was accepted without question by a large portion of the 
newspapers of other parts of the country.&nbsp; New York is a very wicked 
place, but it is not as bad as the above statement would indicate.&nbsp; 
The personal character of the gentleman who made it compels the conviction 
that he believed in the truth of his figures; but a closer examination of 
the case makes it plain that he was singularly deceived by the sources from
which he derived his information.</p>
<p>It is very hard to obtain accurate information as to the criminal 
statistics of this city.&nbsp; The reports and estimates of the Police 
Commissioners are notoriously incomplete and unreliable.&nbsp; They show a 
large number of arrests, but they deal mainly with the class known as 
&ldquo;casuals,&rdquo; persons who merely dabble in crime, and who do not 
make it a profession, and the larger proportion of the arrests reported are
for such trifling offences as drunkenness.&nbsp; Indeed many of the arrests
reported ought not to be counted in the records of crime at all, as the 
persons apprehended are released upon the instant by the officer in charge 
of the station, the arrests being the result of the ignorant zeal <!-- page
523--><a name="page523"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 523</span>or malice of
the patrolmen, and the prisoners being guiltless of any offence.</p>
<p>The population of New York is unlike that of any other American 
city.&nbsp; It is made up of every nationality known to man.&nbsp; The 
majority of the people are very poor.&nbsp; Life with them is one long 
unbroken struggle, and to exist at all is simply to be wretched.&nbsp; They
are packed together at a fearful rate in dirt and wretchedness, and they 
have every incentive to commit crimes which will bring them the means of 
supplying their wants.&nbsp; It is a common habit of some European 
governments to ship their criminals to this port, where they have a new 
field opened to them.&nbsp; The political system of the city teaches the 
lower class to disregard all rights, either of property or person, and, 
indeed, clothes some of the most infamous criminals with an amount of 
influence which is more than dangerous in their hands, and shields them 
from punishment when detected in the commission of crime.&nbsp; All these 
things considered, the wonder is not that the criminal class of the city is
as large as it is; but that it is not larger and more dangerous.</p>
<p>The truth is, that the class generally known as Professional Criminals 
number about 3000.&nbsp; Besides these, there are about 5000 women of 
ill-fame, known as such, living in 600 houses of prostitution, and 
frequenting assignation and bed-houses, about 7000 rum shops, 92 faro 
banks, and about 500 other gambling houses, and lottery and policy offices,
within the limits of the City of New York.</p>
<p>The professional criminals are those who live by thieving, and who 
occasionally vary their career by the commission of a murder or some other 
desperate crime.&nbsp; They rarely resort to violence, however, unless it 
becomes necessary to ensure their own safety.&nbsp; Then they make their 
work as simple and as brief as possible.&nbsp; They form a distinct 
community, frequent certain parts of the city, where they can easily and 
rapidly communicate with each other, and where they can also hide from the 
police without fear of detection.&nbsp; They have signs by which they may 
recognize each other, and a language, or <i>argot</i>, peculiar to 
themselves.&nbsp; Those who have been raised to the <!-- page 524--><a 
name="page524"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 524</span>business use this 
argot to such an extent that to one not accustomed to it they speak in an 
unknown tongue.&nbsp; The following specimens, taken from the 
&ldquo;Detective&rsquo;s Manual,&rdquo; under the head of the letter B, 
will illustrate this:</p>

<p>As a rule, the professional thief of every grade is a very respectable 
looking individual outwardly.&nbsp; He dresses well, but flashily, and is 
generally plentifully supplied with money.&nbsp; In a &ldquo;crib,&rdquo; 
or rendezvous, which he once visited in company with a detective, the 
writer could not select a single individual whose outward appearance 
indicated his calling.&nbsp; The New York thief generally has money, which 
he squanders with great recklessness.&nbsp; It comes to him easily, and it 
goes in the same way.&nbsp; There are many instances on record which go to 
show that the &ldquo;members of the profession&rdquo; are frequently most 
generous to each other in money matters.&nbsp; The thief is usually a man 
of <!-- page 525--><a name="page525"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
525</span>steady habits.&nbsp; He rarely drinks to excess, for that would 
unfit him for his work, and he is not usually given to licentiousness, for 
a similar reason.&nbsp; If he be found living with a woman, she is 
generally a thief also, and plies her trade with equal activity.</p>

<img alt="THE OCCASIONAL FATE OF NEW YORK THIEVES." src="images/p525.jpg"

</a></p>
<p>Altogether, there are about three thousand thieves of various kinds, 
known to the officers of justice in New York, who live by the practice of 
their trade.&nbsp; They are divided into various classes, each known by a 
distinctive title, and to each of which its respective members cling 
tenaciously.&nbsp; These are known as Burglars, Bank Sneaks, Damper Sneaks,
Safe-blowers, Safe-bursters, Safe-breakers, and Sneak Thieves.&nbsp; The 
last constitute the most numerous class.</p>
<p>The Burglar is the aristocrat of crime, and you cannot offend <!-- page 
526--><a name="page526"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 526</span>him more 
than by calling him a thief.&nbsp; He scorns the small game of the sneak 
thief, and conducts his operations on a large scale, in which the risk is 
very great, and the plunder in proportion.&nbsp; His peculiar 
&ldquo;racket&rdquo; is to break open some first-class business house, a 
bonded warehouse, or the vaults of a bank.&nbsp; The burglar class has 
three divisions, known to the police as Safe-blowers, Safe-bursters, and 
Safe-breakers.&nbsp; They are said to be less than 250 in number, those of 
the first and second class comprising about seventy-five members 
each.&nbsp; The safe-blowers are accounted the most skilful.&nbsp; They 
rarely force an entrance into a building, but admit themselves by means of 
false keys made from wax impressions of the genuine keys.&nbsp; Once 
inside, their mode of operation is rapid and systematic.&nbsp; They lower 
the windows from the top about an inch.&nbsp; This is usually sufficient to
prevent the breaking of the glass by the concussion of the air in the room,
and not enough to attract attention from without.&nbsp; The safe is then 
wrapped in wet blankets, to smother the noise of the explosion.&nbsp; Holes
are then drilled in the door of the safe near the lock, these are filled 
with powder, which is fired by a fuse, and the safe is blown open.&nbsp; 
The securing of the contents requires but a few minutes, and the false keys
enable the thieves to escape with ease.&nbsp; This method of robbery is 
very dangerous, as, in spite of the precautions taken, the explosion may 
produce sufficient noise to bring the watchman or the police to the 
spot.&nbsp; Experienced burglars only engage in it, and these never 
undertake it without being sure that the plunder to be secured will fully 
repay them for the danger to be encountered.&nbsp; This knowledge they 
acquire in various ways.</p>
<p>The Safe-bursters are the silent workers of the 
&ldquo;profession.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like the class just mentioned, they enter 
buildings by means of false keys.&nbsp; They adopt a thoroughly systematic 
course, which requires the combined efforts of several persons, and 
consequently they operate in parties of three and four.&nbsp; They first 
make the safe so fast to the floor, by means of clamps, that it will resist
any degree of pressure.&nbsp; Then they drill holes in the door, and into 
these fit jack-screws worked by means of levers.&nbsp; <!-- page 527--><a 
name="page527"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 527</span>The tremendous force 
thus exerted soon cuts the safe literally to pieces, and its contents are 
at the mercy of the thieves.&nbsp; The whole process is noiseless and 
rapid, and so complete has been the destruction of some safes that even the
most experienced detectives have been astounded at the sight of the 
wreck.&nbsp; Such an operation is never undertaken without a knowledge on 
the part of the thieves of the contents of the safe, and the chances of 
conducting the enterprise in safety.&nbsp; The Safe-blowers and bursters do
nothing by chance, and their plans are so well arranged beforehand that 
they rarely fail.</p>
<p>The Safe-breakers, though really a part of the burglar class, are looked
upon with contempt and disowned by their more scientific associates in 
crime.&nbsp; They do nothing by calculation, and trust everything to 
chance.&nbsp; They enter buildings by force, and trust to the same method 
to get into the safes.&nbsp; Their favorite instrument is a 
&ldquo;jimmy,&rdquo; or short iron bar with a sharp end.&nbsp; With this 
they pry open the safe, and then knock it to pieces with a hammer.&nbsp; In
order to deaden the sound of the blows, the hammer is wrapped with 
cloth.&nbsp; They are not as successful as the others in their operations, 
and are most frequently arrested.&nbsp; Indeed the arrests for burglary 
reported by the Police Commissioners occur almost exclusively in this 
class.&nbsp; A really first-class burglar in a prison cell would be a 
curiosity in New York.</p>
<p>Closely allied with the Safe-blowers and bursters is a class known as 
Bed-chamber Sneaks.&nbsp; These men are employed by the burglars to enter 
dwellings and obtain impressions in wax of keys of the places to be 
robbed.&nbsp; They adopt an infinite number of ways of effecting such an 
entrance, often operating through the servant girls.&nbsp; They never 
disturb or carry off anything, but confine their efforts to obtaining 
impressions in wax of the keys of the store or office to be robbed.&nbsp; 
The keys of business houses are mainly kept by the porters, into whose 
humble dwellings it is easy to enter.&nbsp; When they wish to obtain the 
keys of a dwelling, they come as visitors to the servant girls, and while 
they stand chatting with them manage to slip the key from the lock, take 
its impression in wax, and return it <!-- page 528--><a 
name="page528"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 528</span>to the lock, 
unobserved by the girl.&nbsp; They are generally on the watch for chances 
for robberies, and report them promptly to their burglar confederates.</p>
<p>The Bank Sneak is better known as the Bond Robber.&nbsp; He is of 
necessity a man of intelligence and of great fertility of resource.&nbsp; 
He steals United States Bonds almost entirely, and prefers coupons to 
registered, as the former can always be disposed of without 
detection.&nbsp; He manages, by means best known to himself, to gain 
information of the places in which these bonds are kept by the banks, of 
the times at which it is easiest to gain access to them, and the hours at 
which the theft is most likely to be successful.&nbsp; All this requires an
immense amount of patient study and of personal observation of the 
premises, which must be conducted in such a way as not to attract attention
or excite suspicion.&nbsp; When everything is ready for the commission of 
the deed, the thief proceeds to the place where the bonds are kept, seizes 
them and makes off.&nbsp; If a package of bank notes is at hand, he adds 
that to his other plunder.&nbsp; Usually his operations are so well planned
and conducted that he is not observed by the bank officers, and he escapes 
with his plunder.&nbsp; Once at large, he proceeds to sell the bonds, if 
they are coupons, or to use the bank notes, if he has secured any.&nbsp; 
Registered bonds require more care in their disposition.&nbsp; Generally 
the bank offers a reward for the arrest of the robber and the recovery of 
the goods, and calls in a detective to work up the case.&nbsp; The thief at
once manages to communicate with the detective, and offers to compromise 
with the bank, that is, to restore a part of the plunder upon condition 
that he is allowed the rest and escape punishment.&nbsp; Ninety-nine times 
out of a hundred his offer is accepted, the bank preferring the recovery of
a part of its loss to the punishment of the thief.&nbsp; In this way the 
thief secures a large part of the amount stolen, sometimes one-half.&nbsp; 
Should the thief be caught with his plunder upon him, and the bank be thus 
saved from loss, which is rare, the offender is turned over to the police, 
and the bank joins heartily in the effort to send him to the 
penitentiary.</p>
<p>The Damper Sneak confines his attentions to the safes of the <!-- page 
529--><a name="page529"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 529</span>business men
of the city.&nbsp; Wall street has suffered heavily from this class.&nbsp; 
The thief enters a broker&rsquo;s office, in which the safe is generally 
left open during business hours, and asks permission to look at the 
directory, or to write a note.&nbsp; If this permission be accorded him, he
manages to get inside the railing, in close proximity to the safe, if its 
doors are open.&nbsp; A confederate (or sometimes more) now enters and 
attracts the attention of the broker or the clerk, by making fictitious 
arrangements for the purchase of gold or some security.&nbsp; The thief who
first entered watches his opportunity, and then, with the greatest 
rapidity, darts to the safe, abstracts whatever he can lay his bands on, 
and passes out, always thanking the broker for his courtesy.&nbsp; The 
confederates leave soon after, and then the robbery is discovered.&nbsp; 
The Damper Sneak has to steal at random, taking the first thing within his 
reach, but he often secures a rich prize.&nbsp; He takes his peculiar name 
from the safe, which, in the thief language, is called a 
&ldquo;Damper.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the boldest of these robberies occurred 
a year or more ago, in Wall street.&nbsp; A broker employing a number of 
clerks, and doing a heavy business, was standing one day in front of his 
safe, during business hours, talking to a gentleman.&nbsp; A man, without a
hat, with a pen behind his ear, and a piece of paper in his hand, entered 
the office, passed around the counter to where the broker stood, and said 
to him quietly, &ldquo;Will you please to move, sir, so that I can get at 
the safe?&rdquo;&nbsp; Being very much interested in his conversation, the 
broker scarcely noticed the man, supposing from his general appearance and 
manner that he was one of the clerks, and accordingly stepped aside without
giving him a second glance.&nbsp; The man went up to the safe, took out a 
package of United States Bonds, and coolly walked out of the office.&nbsp; 
The bonds amounted to one hundred thousand dollars.&nbsp; The loss was 
discovered in the afternoon but no trace of the thief or of his plunder was
ever found.&nbsp; Strange as it may seem, the city is constantly suffering 
from similar robberies, and the rogues almost invariably escape.</p>
<p>The Sneak Thieves are the last and lowest on the list.&nbsp; As has been
stated, they constitute the bulk of the light-fingered <!-- page 530--><a 
name="page530"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 530</span>fraternity.&nbsp; 
These confine their attentions principally to private dwellings, are adroit
and successful, but incur constant danger of detection and 
punishment.&nbsp; A sneak thief will pass along the street with that rapid,
rolling glance of the eyes which distinguishes the tribe; now he checks 
himself in his career; it is but for an instant; no unprofessional eye 
directed towards him would notice it; but the sudden pause would speak 
volumes to an experienced police officer.&nbsp; He knows that the 
thief&rsquo;s eye has caught the sight of silver lying exposed in the 
basement.&nbsp; In an hour after he hears that the basement has been 
entered, and the silver in it carried off.&nbsp; He knows who has taken it,
as well as if he had seen the man take it with his own eyes; but if the 
thief has had time to run to the nearest receiver&rsquo;s den, the silver 
is already in the melting-pot, beyond the reach of identification.</p>
<p>Sometimes the sneak thieves work in pairs.&nbsp; Upon discovering the 
basement door of a residence ajar, one of them takes position at it, while 
the other ascends the front steps and rings the bell.&nbsp; As soon as the 
servant has gone up from the basement to answer the bell, the thief at the 
lower door slips in, and gathers up the silver or such other articles as he
can lay his hands upon.&nbsp; Again, selecting the dinner hour, which is 
usually between six and seven o&rsquo;clock, and operating in the winter 
season when the streets are dark at that hour, one of the thieves will 
remain on the side-walk, on the lookout for the police, while the other 
climbs up a pillar of the stoop and reaches the level of the second story 
window.&nbsp; The window fastenings offer but a feeble resistance, and he 
is soon in the room.&nbsp; The family being all at dinner in the lower part
of the house, the entire mansion is open to him.&nbsp; Securing his 
plunder, he leaves the house as he entered it, and makes off with his 
confederate.&nbsp; Some of the wealthiest mansions in the city have been 
robbed in this way, and heavy losses in jewelry, furs, and clothing have 
been entailed upon householders in all localities.&nbsp; Sometimes the 
thief has a confederate in the servant girl, but professionals do not often
trust this class, who are always ready to betray them at the slightest 
indication of danger.</p>
<h3><!-- page 531--><a name="page531"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
531</span>II.&nbsp; THE PICK-POCKETS.</h3>
<p>The activity of the pick-pockets of New York is very great, and they 
oftentimes make large &ldquo;hauls&rdquo; in the practice of their 
trade.&nbsp; It is said that there are about 300 of them in the city, 
though the detectives state their belief that the number is really larger 
and increasing.&nbsp; Scarcely a day passes without the police authorities 
receiving numerous complaints from respectable persons of losses by 
pick-pockets.</p>
<p>On all the street cars, you will see the sign, &ldquo;<i>Beware of 
Pick-pockets!</i>&rdquo; posted conspicuously, for the purpose of warning 
passengers.&nbsp; These wretches work in gangs of two, or three or 
four.&nbsp; They make their way into crowded cars, and rarely leave them 
without bringing away something of value.&nbsp; An officer will recognize 
them at once.&nbsp; He sees a well-known pickpocket obstructing the car 
entrance; another pickpocket is abusing him in the sharpest terms for doing
so, while, at the same time, he is eagerly assisting a respectable 
gentleman, or a well-dressed lady, to pass the obstruction.&nbsp; One or 
two other pick-pockets stand near.&nbsp; All this is as intelligible to a 
police officer as the letters on a street sign.&nbsp; He knows that the 
man, who is assisting the gentleman or lady, is picking his or her pocket; 
he knows that the man who obstructs the entrance is his confederate; he 
knows that the others, who are hanging about, will receive the contents of 
the pocket-book as soon as their principal has abstracted the same.&nbsp; 
He cannot arrest them, however, unless he, or some one else, sees the act 
committed; but they will not remain long after they see him&mdash;they will
take the alarm, as they know his eye is on them, and leave the car as soon 
as possible.</p>
<p>A lady, riding in an omnibus, discovers that she has lost her purse, 
which she knows was in her possession when she entered the stage.&nbsp; A 
well-dressed gentleman sits by her, whose arms are quietly crossed before 
him, and his fingers, encased in spotless kid gloves, are entwined in his 
lap, in plain sight of all the <!-- page 532--><a name="page532"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 532</span>passengers, who are sure that he has not moved
them since he entered the stage.&nbsp; Several persons have entered and 
left the vehicle, and the lady, naturally supposing one of them to be the 
thief, gets out to consult a policeman as to her best course.&nbsp; The 
officer could tell her, after a glance at the faultless gentleman who was 
her neighbor, that the arms so conspicuously crossed in his lap, are false,
his real arms all the time being free to operate under the folds of his 
talma.&nbsp; The officer would rightly point him out as the thief.</p>
<p>The ferry-boats which go and come crowded with passengers, the theatres,
and even the churches, are all frequented by pickpockets, who reap rich 
harvests from them.&nbsp; Persons wearing prominent shirt pins or other 
articles of jewelry frequently lose them in this way, and these wretches 
will often boldly take a purse out of a lady&rsquo;s hand or a bracelet 
from her arm, and make off.&nbsp; If the robbery be done in the midst of a 
crowd, the chance of escape is all the better.</p>
<p>The street car conductors complain that they can do nothing to check the
depredations of the pick-pockets.&nbsp; If they are put off the cars, they 
exert themselves to have the conductors discharged, and are generally 
possessed of influence enough to accomplish their ends.&nbsp; Strange as 
this may seem, it is true, for the pick-pocket is generally employed by the
city politicians to manage the rougher class at the elections.&nbsp; In 
return for the influence which they thus exert the pick-pockets receive 
payment in money, and are shielded from punishment if unlucky enough to be 
arrested.&nbsp; Both parties are responsible for this infamous course, the 
party in power usually making the greatest use of these scoundrels.&nbsp; 
This is the cause of the confidence with which thieves of this kind carry 
on their trade.&nbsp; Those who desire the city&rsquo;s welfare will find 
food for reflection in this fact.</p>
<p>Many of the pick-pockets are women, whose lightness and delicacy of 
touch make them dangerous operators.&nbsp; Others are boys.&nbsp; These are
usually termed &ldquo;kids,&rdquo; and are very dangerous, as people are 
not inclined to suspect them.&nbsp; They work in gangs of three or four, 
and, pushing against their victim, seize what they can, and make off.&nbsp;
Sometimes one of this gang <!-- page 533--><a name="page533"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 533</span>is arrested, but as he has transferred the 
plunder to his confederates, who have escaped, there is no evidence against
him.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; THE FEMALE THIEVES.</h3>
<p>In the collection of photographs at the Police Headquarters, to which 
the authorities have given the name of &ldquo;The Rogues&rsquo; 
Gallery,&rdquo; there are but seventy-three portraits of females.&nbsp; The
best informed detectives, however, estimate the actual number of 
professional female thieves in the city at about 350.</p>
<p>Women do not often succeed in effecting large robberies, but the total 
of their stealings makes up a large sum each year.&nbsp; They are not as 
liable to suspicion as men, and most persons hesitate before accusing a 
woman of theft.&nbsp; Yet, if successful, the woman&rsquo;s chances of 
escaping arrest and punishment are better than those of a man.&nbsp; Her 
sex compels her to lead a quieter and more retired life, and she does not 
as a rule frequent places in which she is brought under a detective&rsquo;s
observation.</p>
<p>Some of the female thieves are the children of thief parents, and are 
trained to their lives, others come to such a mode of existence by 
degrees.&nbsp; All, as a rule, are loose women, and were so before they 
became professional thieves.&nbsp; A few of them are well educated, and 
some of these state that they adopted thieving only when all other means 
failed them, and that they hoped it would keep them from sacrificing their 
virtue.&nbsp; This hope proved vain, and imperceptibly they glided into the
latter sin.&nbsp; Some of these women live in handsomely furnished private 
rooms in such localities as Bleecker street.&nbsp; Others herd together in 
the lower quarters of the city.&nbsp; The female thief, even the most 
abandoned, generally has a husband, who is himself a thief or something 
worse.&nbsp; She takes great pride in being a married woman, and whenever 
she gets into trouble invariably seeks to establish a good character by 
producing her marriage certificate.&nbsp; Even the lowest panel thieves 
will do this.</p>
<p><!-- page 534--><a name="page534"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
534</span>The Female Thieves are divided into Pick-pockets, Shoplifters, 
and Panel Thieves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A short while ago a private detective happened to drop into a 
large dry-goods store in Grand street, and observed a handsome-looking 
girl, about eighteen years old, dressed with the best taste, pricing laces 
at a counter.&nbsp; An indefinable expression about her eyes was 
suspicious, and as she left the store without purchasing, the spectator 
followed her to the corner of Essex Market, where, walking beside her, he 
noticed something of a square form under her cloak.&nbsp; At once 
suspecting it to be a stolen card of lace, he jostled against her, and, as 
he suspected, the card of lace fell from under her arm to the 
sidewalk.&nbsp; She colored, and was walking away without picking it up 
when the detective stopped her, said he knew the lace was stolen, and that 
she must return to the shop.&nbsp; She begged of him not to arrest her but 
restore the lace, which he did.&nbsp; After thanking him for not taking her
into custody, she invited him to call on her and learn the story of her 
life.&nbsp; She has two rooms in a very respectable locality, furnished in 
the best manner, several of Prang&rsquo;s chromos are hung on the walls, 
and a piano, on which she plays well, is in her sitting-room.&nbsp; She is 
very well educated, and was driven into her way of life by being left 
without friends or help, and one day stole a shawl without being 
discovered.&nbsp; Emboldened by the success of her first theft, she chose 
shop-lifting as her way of life, has followed it ever since, and was never 
in prison.&nbsp; Some few call her Sarah Wright; but those who know her 
best style her &lsquo;Anonyma,&rsquo; as she dislikes the former 
title.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV.&nbsp; THE RIVER THIEVES.</h3>
<p>The Harbor Thieves constitute one of the most dangerous and active 
portions of the criminal class.&nbsp; There are only about fifty 
professional thieves of this class, but they give the police a vast amount 
of trouble, and inflict great loss in the aggregate <!-- page 535--><a 
name="page535"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 535</span>upon the mercantile 
community.&nbsp; Twenty years ago the harbor was infested with a gang of 
pirates, who not only committed the most daring robberies, but also added 
nightly murders to their misdeeds.&nbsp; Their victims were thrown into the
deep waters of the river or bay, and all trace of the foul work was 
removed.&nbsp; At length, however, the leaders of the gang, Saul and 
Howlett by name, mere lads both, were arrested, convicted, and executed, 
and for a while a stop was put to the robberies in the harbor; but in 
course of time the infamous trade was resumed, but without its old 
accompaniment of murder.&nbsp; It is at present carried on with great 
activity in spite of the efforts of the police to put a stop to it.&nbsp; 
The North River front of the city is troubled with but one gang of these 
ruffian&rsquo;s, which has its headquarters at the foot of Charlton 
street.&nbsp; This front is lined with piers which are well built, well 
lighted, and well guarded, being occupied chiefly by steamboats plying on 
the river, and by the foreign and coasting steamships.&nbsp; The East River
is not so well guarded, the piers are dark, and the vessels, mostly sailing
ships, are left to the protection of their crews.&nbsp; It is in this 
river, therefore, and in the harbor, that the principal depredations of the
river thieves are carried on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Slaughter House Point,&rdquo; 
the intersection of James and South streets, and so called by the police 
because of the many murders which have occurred there, is the principal 
rendezvous of the East River thieves.&nbsp; Hook Dock, at the foot of 
Cherry street, is also one of their favorite gathering places.</p>
<p>The life of a river thief is a very hard one, and his gains, as a rule, 
are small.&nbsp; He is subjected to a great deal of manual labor in the 
effort to secure his plunder, and is exposed to all sorts of weather.&nbsp;
Night work in an open boat in New York harbor is not favorable to 
longevity, and in eight or ten years the most robust constitution will give
way before the constant attacks of rheumatism and neuralgia.&nbsp; There 
would be some compensation to society in this but for the fact that the 
police, whose duty it is to watch the river thieves, suffer in a similar 
way.</p>
<p>The river thieves generally work in gangs of three and four.&nbsp; Each 
gang has its rowboat, which is constructed with reference <!-- page 
536--><a name="page536"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 536</span>to carrying 
off as much plunder as possible, and making the best attainable time when 
chased by the harbor police.&nbsp; The thieves will not go out on a 
moonlight or even a bright starlight night.&nbsp; Nights when the darkness 
is so thick that it hides everything, or when the harbor is covered with a 
dense fog, are most favorable to them.&nbsp; Then, emerging from their 
starting point, they pull to the middle of the stream, where they lie-to 
long enough to ascertain if they are observed or followed.&nbsp; Then they 
pull swiftly to the point where the vessel they mean to rob is lying.&nbsp;
Their oars are muffled, and their boat glides along noiselessly through the
darkness.&nbsp; Frequently they pause for a moment, and listen to catch the
sound of the oars of the police-boats, if any are on their track.&nbsp; 
Upon reaching the vessel, they generally manage to board her by means of 
her chains, or some rope which is hanging down her side.&nbsp; The crew are
asleep, and the watch is similarly overcome.&nbsp; The thieves are cautions
and silent in their movements, and succeed in securing their spoil without 
awakening any one.&nbsp; They will steal anything they can get their hands 
on, but deal principally in articles which cannot be identified, such as 
sugar, coffee, tea, rice, cotton, etc.&nbsp; They go provided with their 
own bags, and fill these from the original bags, barrels, or cases in which
these articles are found on the ship.&nbsp; They are very careful to take 
away with them nothing which has a distinctive mark by which it may be 
identified.&nbsp; Having filled their boat, they slip over the side of the 
ship into it, and pull back to a point on shore designated beforehand, and,
landing, convey their plunder to the shop of a junkman with whom they have 
already arranged matters, where they dispose of it for ready money.&nbsp; 
They do not confine their operations to vessels lying at the East River 
piers of New York, but rob those discharging cargo at the Brooklyn stores, 
or lying at anchor in the East or North rivers, even going as far as to 
assail those lying at quarantine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p537.jpg">
<img alt="THE RIVER THIEVES." src="images/p537.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In order to check their operations as far as possible, a force of about 
thirty policemen, under Captain James Todd, is assigned to duty in the 
harbor.&nbsp; The headquarters of this force are on a steamer, which boat 
was expected to accomplish wonders, but <!-- page 538--><a 
name="page538"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 538</span>which is too large 
and clumsy to be of any real service.&nbsp; In consequence of this, Captain
Todd is obliged to patrol the harbor with row-boats, of which there are 
several.&nbsp; These boats visit all the piers on the two rivers, and 
search for thieves or their boats.&nbsp; Sometimes the thieves are 
encountered just as they are approaching a pier with their boat filled with
stolen property, and again the chase will be kept up clear across the 
harbor.&nbsp; If they once get sight of them, the police rarely fail to 
overhaul the thieves.&nbsp; Generally the latter submit without a struggle,
but sometimes a fight ensues.</p>
<p>The thieves, however, prefer to submit where they have such goods as 
rice, sugar, coffee, or tea in their possession.&nbsp; They know that it 
will be impossible to convict them, and they prefer a slight detention to 
the consequences of a struggle with their captors.&nbsp; The merchant or 
master of the ship, from whom the goods are stolen, may feel sure in his 
own mind that the articles found in the possession of the thieves are his 
property, but he cannot swear that they are his, it being simply impossible
to identify such goods.&nbsp; And so the magistrate, though satisfied of 
the theft, must discharge the prisoner and return him the stolen 
goods.&nbsp; The only charge against him is that he was found under 
suspicious circumstances with these articles in his possession.&nbsp; From 
three to four river thieves are arrested every week, but, for the reason 
given, few are punished.&nbsp; Sometimes, in order to secure their 
conviction, the police turn over the thieves to the United States 
authorities, by whom they are charged with smuggling, this charge being 
based upon their being found in possession of goods on which they can show 
no payment of duties.&nbsp; Sometimes they are prosecuted, not for larceny,
but for violating the quarantine laws in boarding vessels detained at 
quarantine.</p>
<p>Several times the most daring of the river thieves have robbed the piers
of the European steamship lines.&nbsp; In one instance, they passed under 
the pier of the Cunard steamers at Jersey City, cut out a portion of the 
flooring, and removed several valuable packages through the opening thus 
made.&nbsp; They then replaced the flooring, and secured it in its place by
means of <!-- page 539--><a name="page539"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
539</span>lifting-jacks, and decamped with their plunder.&nbsp; The next 
night they returned and removed other packages, and for several nights the 
performance was repeated.&nbsp; The company&rsquo;s agent, upon the 
discovery of the loss, exerted himself actively to discover the thieves, 
but without success.&nbsp; The watchmen on shore were positive that the 
warehouse, which is built on the pier, had not been entered from the land, 
and there were no signs to be discovered of its having been forced from the
water side.&nbsp; Matters began to look bad for the watchmen, when, one 
night, the harbor police unexpectedly made a dash under the pier and caught
the thieves at their work.</p>
<p>The North River gang are said to own a fine schooner, in which they 
cruise along the Hudson almost to Albany, and carry on a system of piracy 
at the river towns.&nbsp; Farmers and country merchants suffer greatly from
their depredations.&nbsp; A year or so ago, it was rumored that they were 
commanded by a beautiful and dashing woman, but this story is now believed 
to be a mere fiction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another gang is called the &lsquo;Daybreak Boys,&rsquo; from the 
fact that none of them are a dozen years of age, and that they always 
select the hour of dawn for their depredations, which are exclusively 
confined to the small craft moored in the East River just below Hell 
Gate.&nbsp; They find the men on these vessels locked in the deep sleep of 
exhaustion, the result of their severe labors of the day; and as there are 
no watchmen, they meet little difficulty in rifling not only the vessels, 
but the persons of those on board.&nbsp; If there is any such thing as a 
watch or money, it is sure to disappear; and it has often happened that one
of these vessels has been robbed of every portable article on board, 
including every article of clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 540--><a name="page540"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
540</span>V.&nbsp; THE FENCES.</h3>
<p>In the thief language, a person who buys stolen goods is called a 
&ldquo;Fence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without his fence, the thief could do nothing, 
<!-- page 541--><a name="page541"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
541</span>for he could not dispose of his plunder without a serious risk of
detection.&nbsp; The Fence, however, is not known as a thief, and can buy 
and sell with a freedom which renders it easy for him to dispose of all 
stolen property which comes into his hands.&nbsp; A noted thief once 
declared that a man in his business was powerless to accomplish anything 
unless he knew the names and characters of all the Fences in the city.</p>
<p>The professional Fences of New York are as well known to the police as 
they are to the thieves.&nbsp; Their stores are located in Chatham street, 
in the Bowery, and other public thoroughfares, and even Broadway itself has
one or more of these establishments within its limits.&nbsp; Some of the 
Fences are dirty, wretched-looking creatures; but one at least&mdash;the 
Broadway dealer&mdash;is a fine-looking, well-dressed man, with the manners
and bearing of a gentleman.&nbsp; All are alike in one respect, 
however.&nbsp; They all buy and sell that which has been stolen.&nbsp; They
drive hard bargains with the thieves who offer them goods, paying them but 
a small portion of the actual value of the prize.&nbsp; If the article is 
advertised, and a reward sufficiently in excess of what he paid for it is 
offered, the Fence frequently returns it to its rightful owner, upon 
condition that no questions shall be asked, and claims the reward.&nbsp; 
Vigorous efforts have been made by the police authorities to bring the 
Fences to justice, but without success.&nbsp; The necessary legal evidence 
can rarely be obtained, and though numerous arrests have been made, 
scarcely a conviction has followed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p541.jpg">
<img alt="A FENCE STORE IN CHATHAM STREET." src="images/p541.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Fences are well skilled in the art of baffling justice.&nbsp; The 
study of the means of rapidly and effectually removing the marks by which 
the property in their hands can be identified, is the main business of 
their lives, and they acquire a degree of skill and dexterity in altering 
or effacing these marks which is truly surprising.&nbsp; A melting-pot is 
always over the fire, to which all silverware is consigned the instant it 
is received.&nbsp; The marks on linen, towels, and handkerchiefs are 
removed, sometimes by chemicals, sometimes by fine scissors made expressly 
for the purpose.&nbsp; Jewelry is at once removed from its settings, and 
the gold is either melted or the engraving is burnished out, <!-- page 
542--><a name="page542"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 542</span>so as in 
either case to make identification impossible.&nbsp; Rich velvet and silk 
garments are transmogrified by the removal and re-arrangement of the 
buttons and trimmings.&nbsp; Pointed edges are rounded, and rounded edges 
are pointed, entirely changing the whole aspect of the garment, with such 
celerity that the lady who had worn the dress in the morning would not have
the slightest suspicion that it was the same in the evening.&nbsp; Cotton, 
wool, rags, and old ropes require no manipulation.&nbsp; When once thrown 
upon the heap, they defy the closest scrutiny of the owners.&nbsp; There is
scarcely an article which can be the subject of theft, which the resources 
of these men do not enable them, in a very short time, to disguise beyond 
the power of recognition.&nbsp; Their premises are skilfully arranged for 
concealment.&nbsp; They are abundantly provided with secret doors and 
sliding panels, communicating with dark recesses.&nbsp; Apertures are cut 
in the partitions, so that a person coming in from the front can be 
distinctly seen before he enters the apartment.&nbsp; The Fence is as well 
skilled as any lawyer in the nature of evidence.&nbsp; He knows the 
difference between probability and proof as well as Sir William Hamilton 
himself.&nbsp; He does not trouble himself about any amount of 
probabilities that the detectives may accumulate against him; but the said 
detectives must be remarkably expert if they are ever able to get anything 
against him which will amount to strictly legal proof.</p>
<p>The Fences not only deal with thieves, but carry on a large business 
with clerks, salesmen, and porters, who steal goods from their employers, 
and bring them to the Fences for sale.</p>

<img alt="THE ROUGH&rsquo;S PARADISE." src="images/p543.jpg" />
</a></p>
<h3>VI.&nbsp; THE ROUGHS.</h3>
<p>Another class of those who live in open defiance of the law consists of 
the &ldquo;Roughs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The New York Rough is simply a 
ruffian.&nbsp; He is usually of foreign parentage, though born in America, 
and in personal appearance is as near like a huge English bull-dog as it is
possible for a human being to resemble <!-- page 544--><a 
name="page544"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 544</span>a brute.&nbsp; Of the
two, the dog is the nobler animal.&nbsp; The Rough is not usually a 
professional thief, though he will steal if he has a chance, and often does
steal in order to procure the means of raising money.&nbsp; He is familiar 
with crime of all kinds, for he was born in the slums and has never known 
anything better.&nbsp; In some cases he can read, in others he 
cannot.&nbsp; Those who can read never make use of their talent for any 
purpose of improvement.&nbsp; Their staple literature consists of the flash
papers and obscene books.&nbsp; They are thoroughly versed in the history 
of crime, and nothing pleases them so much as a sensational account of an 
execution, a prize fight, or a murder.&nbsp; They are the patrons and 
supporters of dog and rat pits, and every brutal sport.&nbsp; Their boon 
companions are the keepers of the low-class bar rooms and dance houses, 
prize fighters, thieves, and fallen women.&nbsp; There is scarcely a Rough 
in the city but has a mistress among the lost sisterhood.&nbsp; The 
redeeming feature of the lives of some of these women is the devotion with 
which they cling to their &ldquo;man.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rough, on his part, 
beats and robs the woman, but protects her from violence or wrong at the 
hands of others.&nbsp; A large majority of these scoundrels have no other 
means of support than the infamous earnings of their mistresses.</p>
<p>Unlike the brute, the Rough is insensible to kindness.&nbsp; Civility is
thrown away upon him.&nbsp; Usually he resents it.&nbsp; His delight is to 
fall upon some unoffending and helpless person, and beat him to a 
jelly.&nbsp; Sometimes&mdash;indeed commonly&mdash;he adds robbery to these
assaults.&nbsp; Often gangs of Roughs will enter the pleasure grounds in 
the upper part of the city, in which a pic-nic or social gathering is going
on, for the sole purpose of breaking up the meeting.&nbsp; They fall upon 
the unoffending pleasure-seekers, beat the men unmercifully, maltreat, 
insult, and sometimes outrage the women, rob all parties who have valuables
to be taken, and then make their escape.&nbsp; Pleasure parties of this 
kind are usually unprovided with the means of resistance, while their 
assailants are well armed.&nbsp; It sometimes happens, however, that the 
pleasure seekers are more than a match for the Roughs, who, in such cases, 
are driven out after very severe handling.</p>
<p><!-- page 545--><a name="page545"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
545</span>The Rough does not hesitate to commit murder, or to outrage a 
woman.&nbsp; He is capable of any crime.&nbsp; He is a sort of human hyena 
who lives only to prey upon the better portions of the community.&nbsp; 
Sometimes he degenerates into a burglar or common thief, sometimes he 
becomes the proprietor of a panel house or a policy office.&nbsp; 
Crime-stained and worthy of punishment as he is, he walks the streets with 
a sense of security equal to that of the most innocent man.</p>
<p>This feeling of security is caused by the conviction on his part that he
will not be punished for his misdeeds.&nbsp; The reason is simple: He is a 
voter, and he has influence with others of his class.&nbsp; He is necessary
to the performance of the dirty work of the city politicians, and as soon 
as he gets into trouble, the politicians exert themselves to secure his 
discharge.&nbsp; They are usually successful, and consequently but few 
Roughs are ever punished in New York, no matter how revolting their 
crime.&nbsp; This is not all, however.&nbsp; There are well authenticated 
instances in which men of this class have been carried by their fellows, 
oftentimes by ballot-box stuffing and fraudulent voting, into high and 
responsible offices under the city.&nbsp; The recent state of affairs under
the Ring illustrates the results of this system.</p>
<p>In the year 1871, 179 persons were &ldquo;found drowned&rdquo; in the 
waters of the city.&nbsp; Of these, many are supposed, with good reason, to
have been the victims of foul play at the hands of the Roughs.&nbsp; In the
same year, 42 persons were murdered in New York, and one man was hanged by 
the officers of the law.</p>
<h2><!-- page 546--><a name="page546"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
546</span>XLIV.&nbsp; THE PAWNBROKERS.</h2>
<p>The sign of the Lombards is very common in the great city.&nbsp; In the 
Bowery, East Broadway, Chatham, Catharine, Division, Oliver, Canal, and 
Grand streets, the three gilt balls are thickest, but they may also be seen
in every portion of the city in which there is poverty and suffering.&nbsp;
The law recognizes the fact that in all large communities these dealers are
a necessary evil, and, while tolerating them as such, endeavors to 
interpose a safeguard in behalf of the community, by requiring that none 
but persons of good character and integrity shall exercise the 
calling.&nbsp; They must have been dreamers who framed this law, or they 
must have known but little of the class who carry on this business.&nbsp; 
The truth is, that there is not a pawnbroker of &ldquo;good character and 
integrity&rdquo; in the city.&nbsp; In New York the Mayor alone has the 
power of licensing them, and revoking their licence, and none but those so 
licensed can conduct their business in the city.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; 
says the Report of the New York Prison Association, &ldquo;Mayors of all 
cliques and parties have exercised this power with, apparently, little 
sense of the responsibility which rests upon them.&nbsp; They have not, 
ordinarily at least, required clear proof of the integrity of the 
applicants; but have usually licensed every applicant possessed of 
political influence.&nbsp; There is scarcely an instance where they have 
revoked a licence thus granted, even when they have been furnished with 
proofs of the dishonesty of the holders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pawnbrokers are, with scarcely an exception, the most rascally set 
to be found in the city.&nbsp; They are not generally receivers of goods 
which they know to be stolen, for there is too much risk to them in 
carrying on such a business.&nbsp; Their shops <!-- page 547--><a 
name="page547"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 547</span>are overhauled almost
every week by the detectives in searching for stolen property, and the 
pawnbrokers, as a class, prefer to turn over this business entirely to the 
Fences.&nbsp; Some of the most reckless, however, will receive pledges 
which they know to have been stolen, and the police occasionally find 
stolen goods on their hands.&nbsp; Upon one occasion, a whole basket of 
watches was found in one of these establishments.&nbsp; Another was found 
in possession of a diamond which was identified by its owner.&nbsp; It had 
been stolen by a servant girl.&nbsp; It was worth over seven hundred 
dollars, and had been pawned for two dollars and a half.</p>
<p>The pawnbrokers, though not receivers of stolen goods, are not a whit 
better.&nbsp; They are the meanest of thieves and swindlers.&nbsp; Section 
eight of the statute, under which they hold their licences, requires that, 
&ldquo;No pawnbroker shall ask, demand, or receive any greater rate of 
interest than twenty-five per cent. per annum upon any loan not exceeding 
the sum of twenty-five dollars, or than seven per cent. per annum upon any 
loan exceeding the sum of twenty-five dollars, under the penalty of one 
hundred dollars for every such offence.&rdquo;&nbsp; This law is invariably
violated by the pawnbroker, who trades upon the ignorance of his 
customers.&nbsp; The rate habitually charged for loaning money is three per
cent. a month, or any fractional part of a month, or thirty-six per cent. a
year, regardless of the amount.&nbsp; Many laboring men and women pawn the 
same articles regularly on the first of the week, and redeem them on 
Saturday when their wages are paid them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following is a schedule of charges made on articles 
irrespective of interest: On diamonds, watches, jewelry, silverware, 
opera-glasses, articles of <i>vertu</i>, ten per cent. on the amount 
loaned, over and above the interest, for what is called putting them away 
in the safes.&nbsp; On coats, vests, pants, dresses, cloaks, skirts, 
basques, from twenty cents to one dollar is charged for hanging up.&nbsp; 
On laces, silks, velvets, shawls, etc., from twenty-five cents to one 
dollar for putting away in bureau, wardrobe or drawer.&nbsp; For wrappers 
from fifteen to fifty cents is charged.&nbsp; Persons offering goods done 
up in papers are compelled to hire <!-- page 548--><a 
name="page548"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 548</span>a wrapper, or the 
pawnbroker refuses to advance.&nbsp; The wrapper is simply a dirty piece of
old muslin.&nbsp; The hire of one of these wrappers has been known to have 
amounted to over five dollars in one year.&nbsp; Upon trunks, valises, 
beds, pillows, carpets, tool-chests, musical instruments, sewing machines, 
clocks, pictures, etc., etc., in proportion to their bulk, from one dollar 
to five dollars is charged for storage.&nbsp; A still greater profit to the
pawnbrokers is the penny fraud.&nbsp; They buy pennies, getting from 104 to
108 for one dollar.&nbsp; These they pay out, and on every $100 thus paid 
out an average gain of six dollars is made.&nbsp; This amounts to something
with the prominent ones, who often pay out many hundred dollars in a 
day.&nbsp; Another source of profit is the surplus over the amount loaned 
which the pawnbroker receives from the sales of unredeemed pledges.&nbsp; 
This surplus, although belonging to the depositor, according to law, is 
never paid.&nbsp; In fact, not one in a thousand who have dealings with 
pawnbrokers is aware of his rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a rule, these wretches grow rich very fast.&nbsp; They are 
principally Jews of the lowest class.&nbsp; They allow their wives and 
children to wear the jewelry, ornaments, and finer clothing placed in their
keeping, and in this way save much of the ordinary expense of the head of a
family.&nbsp; In the case of clothing, the articles are frequently worn out
by their families.&nbsp; They are either returned in this condition when 
demanded, or the owner is told that they cannot be found.&nbsp; Payment for
them is always refused.&nbsp; As has been stated, they refuse to pay to the
owner the amount received in excess of the loan for an article which has 
been sold.&nbsp; This, added to their excessive rate of interest, is said 
to make their gains amount to nearly five hundred per cent. on the capital 
invested in their business&mdash;&ldquo;the Jews&rsquo; five per 
cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The principal customers are the poor.&nbsp; Persons of former 
respectability or wealth, widows and orphans, are always sure to carry with
them into their poverty some of the trinkets that were theirs in the heyday
of prosperity.&nbsp; These articles go one by one to buy bread.&nbsp; The 
pawnbroker advances not more than a twentieth part of their value, and 
haggles over that.&nbsp; He <!-- page 549--><a name="page549"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 549</span>knows full well that the pledges will never be
redeemed, that these unhappy creatures must grow less able every day to 
recover them.&nbsp; Jewelry, clothing, ornaments of all kinds, and even the
wedding ring of the wife and mother, come to him one by one, never to be 
regained by their owners.&nbsp; He takes them at a mere pittance, and sells
them at a profit of several hundred per cent.</p>
<p>You may see the poor pass into the doors of these shops every day.&nbsp;
The saddest faces we ever saw were those of women coming away from 
them.&nbsp; Want leaves its victims no choice, but drives them mercilessly 
into the clutches of the pawnbroker.</p>
<p>The majority of the articles pawned are forced there by want, 
undoubtedly, but very many of them go to buy drink.&nbsp; Women are driven 
by brutal husbands to this course, and there are wretches who will 
absolutely steal the clothing from their shivering wives and little ones, 
and with them procure the means of buying gin.</p>
<p>Of late years another class of pawnbrokers, calling themselves 
&ldquo;Diamond Brokers,&rdquo; has appeared in the city.&nbsp; They make 
advances on the jewels of persons&mdash;mostly women&mdash;in need of 
money.&nbsp; The extravagance of fashionable life brings them many 
customers.&nbsp; They drive as hard bargains as the others of their class, 
and their transactions being larger, they grow rich quicker.&nbsp; They are
very discreet, and all dealings with them are carried on in the strictest 
secrecy, but, were they disposed, they could tell many a strange tale by 
which the peace of some &ldquo;highly respectable families&rdquo; in the 
Avenue would be rudely disturbed.</p>
<h2><!-- page 550--><a name="page550"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
550</span>XLV.&nbsp; THE BEER-GARDENS.</h2>
<p>In some respects, New York is as much German as American.&nbsp; A large 
part of it is a genuine reproduction of the Fatherland as regards the 
manners, customs, people, and language spoken.&nbsp; In the thickly settled
sections east of the Bowery the Germans predominate, and one might live 
there for a year without ever hearing an English word spoken.&nbsp; The 
Germans of New York are a very steady, hard-working people, and withal very
sociable.&nbsp; During the day they confine themselves closely to business,
and at night they insist upon enjoying themselves.&nbsp; The huge Stadt 
Theatre draws several thousand within its walls whenever its doors are 
opened, and concerts and festivals of various kinds attract others.&nbsp; 
But the most popular of all places with this class of citizens is the 
beer-garden.&nbsp; Here one can sit and smoke, and drink beer by the 
gallon, listen to music, move about, meet his friends, and enjoy himself in
his own way&mdash;all at a moderate cost.</p>
<p>From one end of the Bowery to the other, beer-gardens abound, and their 
brilliantly illuminated signs and transparencies form one of the most 
remarkable features of that curious street.&nbsp; Not all of them are 
reputable.&nbsp; In some there is a species of theatrical performance which
is often broadly indecent.&nbsp; These are patronized by but few Germans, 
although they are mainly carried on by men of that nationality.&nbsp; The 
Rough and servant girl elements predominate in the audiences, and there is 
an unmistakably Irish stamp on most of the faces present.</p>
<p>The true beer-garden finds its highest development in the monster 
Atlantic Garden, which is located in the Bowery, next <!-- page 551--><a 
name="page551"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 551</span>door to the Old 
Bowery Theatre.&nbsp; It is an immense room, with a lofty curved ceiling, 
handsomely frescoed, and lighted by numerous chandeliers and by brackets 
along the walls.&nbsp; It is lighted during the day from the roof.&nbsp; At
one side is an open space planted with trees and flowers, the only mark of 
a garden visible.&nbsp; A large gallery rises above the floor at each 
end.&nbsp; That at the eastern or upper end is used as a restaurant for 
those who desire regular meals.&nbsp; The lower gallery is, like the rest 
of the place, for beer-drinkers only.&nbsp; Under the latter gallery is a 
shooting hall, which is usually filled with marksmen trying their 
skill.&nbsp; On the right hand side of the room is a huge orchestrion or 
monster music-box, and by its side is a raised platform, occupied by the 
orchestra employed at the place.&nbsp; The floor is sanded, and is lined 
with plain tables, six feet by two in size, to each of which is a couple of
benches.&nbsp; The only ornaments of the immense hall are the frescoes and 
the chandeliers.&nbsp; Everything else is plain and substantial.&nbsp; 
Between the hall and the Bowery is the bar room, with its lunch 
counters.&nbsp; The fare provided at the latter is strictly German, but the
former retails drinks of every description.</p>
<p>During the day the Atlantic does a good business through its bar and 
restaurant, many persons taking their meals here regularly.&nbsp; As night 
comes on, the great hall begins to fill up, and by eight o&rsquo;clock the 
place is in its glory.&nbsp; From three to four thousand people, mainly 
Germans, may be seen here at one time, eating, drinking, smoking.&nbsp; 
Strong liquors are not sold, the drinks being beer and the lighter 
Rhine-wines.&nbsp; The German capacity for holding beer is immense.&nbsp; 
An amount sufficient to burst an American makes him only comfortable and 
good humored.&nbsp; The consumption of the article here nightly is 
tremendous, but there is no drunkenness.&nbsp; The audience is well 
behaved, and the noise is simply the hearty merriment of a large 
crowd.&nbsp; There is no disorder, no indecency.&nbsp; The place is 
thoroughly respectable, and the audience are interested in keeping it 
so.&nbsp; They come here with their families, spend a social, pleasant 
evening, meet their friends, hear the news, enjoy the music and the beer, 
and go home refreshed and happy.&nbsp; The <!-- page 553--><a 
name="page553"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 553</span>Germans are very 
proud of this resort, and they would not tolerate the introduction of any 
feature that would make it an unfit place for their wives and 
daughters.&nbsp; It is a decided advantage to the people who frequent this 
place, whatever the Temperance advocates may say, that men have here a 
resort where they can enjoy themselves with their families, instead of 
seeking their pleasure away from the society of their wives and 
children.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="THE ATLANTIC GARDEN." src="images/p552.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The buzz and the hum of the conversation, and the laughter, are 
overpowering, and you wander through the vast crowd with your ears deafened
by the sound.&nbsp; Suddenly the leader of the orchestra raps sharply on 
his desk, and there is a profound silence all over the hall.&nbsp; In an 
instant the orchestra breaks forth into some wonderful German melody, or 
some deep-voiced, strong-lunged singer sends his rich notes rolling through
the hall.&nbsp; The auditors have suddenly lost their merriment, and are 
now listening pensively to the music, which is good.&nbsp; They sip their 
beer absently, and are thinking no doubt of the far-off Fatherland, for you
see their features grow softer and their eyes glisten.&nbsp; Then, when it 
is all over, they burst into an enthusiastic encore, or resume their 
suspended conversations.</p>
<p>On the night of the reception of the news of Napoleon&rsquo;s 
capitulation at Sedan, the Atlantic Garden was a sight worth seeing.&nbsp; 
The orchestra was doubled, and the music and the songs were all 
patriotic.&nbsp; The hall was packed with excited people, and the huge 
building fairly rocked with the cheers which went up from it.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;German&rsquo;s Fatherland&rdquo; and Luther&rsquo;s Hymn were sung 
by five thousand voices, hoarse or shrill with excitement.&nbsp; Oceans of 
beer were drunk, men and women shook hands and embraced, and the excitement
was kept up until long after midnight.&nbsp; Yet nobody was drunk, save 
with the excitement of the moment.</p>
<p>The Central Park Garden, at the corner of Seventh avenue and Fifty-ninth
street, is more of an American institution than the Atlantic.&nbsp; It 
consists of a handsome hall surrounded on three sides by a gallery, and 
opening at the back upon grounds a moderate size, tastefully laid out, and 
adorned with rustic <!-- page 554--><a name="page554"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 554</span>stalls and arbors for the use of guests.&nbsp;
At the Atlantic the admission is free.&nbsp; Here one pays fifty cents for 
the privilege of entering the grounds and building.&nbsp; During the summer
months nightly concerts, with Saturday matin&eacute;es, are given here by 
Theodore Thomas and his famous orchestra&mdash;the finest organization of 
its kind in America.&nbsp; The music is of a high order, and is rendered in
a masterly manner.&nbsp; Many lovers of music come to New York in the 
summer simply to hear these concerts.</p>
<p>The place is the fashionable resort of the city in the summer.&nbsp; The
audience is equal to anything to be seen in the city.&nbsp; One can meet 
here all the celebrities who happen to be in town, and as every one is free
to do as he pleases, there is no restraint to hamper one&rsquo;s 
enjoyment.&nbsp; You may sit and smoke and drink, or stroll through the 
place the whole evening, merely greeting your acquaintances with a nod, or 
you may join them, and chat to your heart&rsquo;s content.&nbsp; 
Refreshments and liquors of all kinds are sold to guests; but the prices 
are high.&nbsp; The Central Park Garden, or, as it is called by strangers, 
&ldquo;Thomas&rsquo;s Garden,&rdquo; is the most thoroughly enjoyable place
in the city in the summer.</p>

555</span>XLVI.&nbsp; JAMES FISK JR.</h2>
<p>James Fisk, Jr., was born at Bennington, Vermont, on the 1st of April, 
1834.&nbsp; His father was a pedlar, and the early life of the boy was 
passed in hard work.&nbsp; What little education he received was obtained 
at the public schools.&nbsp; At the age of seventeen he obtained his first 
employment, being engaged by Van Amburgh to clean out the cages of the 
animals in his menagerie and to assist in the erection of the tents.&nbsp; 
He made himself so useful to his employer that he was soon promoted to the 
position of ticket receiver.&nbsp; He remained with Van Amburgh for eight 
years, travelling with him through the United States, Canada, and Europe, 
and, at the age of twenty-five, left him to begin life for himself in the 
calling of his father.&nbsp; He went back to Vermont, and began peddling 
such small articles as steel pens and lead pencils through the towns of the
State.&nbsp; He succeeded in acquiring and saving a small sum of money, and
was able to borrow a little more.&nbsp; He then purchased a horse and 
wagon, and began a series of more extended operations as a pedlar of dry 
goods.&nbsp; He visited all the principal towns and villages of Vermont, 
and met with a ready sale for his goods.&nbsp; His energy and business tact
were eminently successful, and his business soon grew to such an extent 
that his one-horse wagon was too small for it.&nbsp; He accordingly sold 
this vehicle, and purchased a handsome &ldquo;four in hand,&rdquo; with 
which he travelled through Massachusetts and Connecticut, as well as 
Vermont.&nbsp; He was very popular with his customers, and established a 
reputation for fair dealing, selling good articles at a moderate 
profit.</p>
<p>His energy and success attracted the attention of the Boston wholesale 
house from which he bought his goods, and they <!-- page 556--><a 
name="page556"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 556</span>thinking that he 
would prove a useful acquisition to them, offered him an interest in their 
business.&nbsp; Their offer was accepted; and, in 1860, he became a partner
in the house of Jordan, Marsh &amp; Co., of Boston.&nbsp; He was sent South
by the firm, and though he succeeded in conducting for them several large 
and profitable transactions during the early part of the war, and though 
they remained his friends to the close of his life, the connection was not 
altogether satisfactory to them, and, in 1862, they purchased his interest 
in the business for the sum of $64,000.</p>
<p>About this time, some capitalists in Boston were desirous of purchasing 
the Stonington line of steamboats, then owned by Daniel Drew.&nbsp; Fisk 
became aware of their desire, and, coming to New York, in 1863, obtained an
introduction to Daniel Drew, and so won the favor and confidence of that 
gentleman that he was employed by him to manage the negotiation for the 
sale of the steamers, which he did to Mr. Drew&rsquo;s entire 
satisfaction.&nbsp; From that time, Drew became his friend, and soon gained
him a position in Wall street.</p>
<p>Upon entering the street, Fisk began a series of speculations on his own
account, and, in the short space of two years, he lost all his money.&nbsp;
It is said that he swore a mighty oath that as Wall street had ruined him, 
Wall street should pay for it.&nbsp; Daniel Drew now came to his aid, and, 
in 1865, helped him to form the firm of Fisk, Belden &amp; Co., 
stock-brokers, and assisted the new house by employing them as his brokers 
in many of his heaviest transactions.</p>

<p>In 1867 occurred the great struggle between Drew and Vanderbilt for the 
possession of the Erie Railway.&nbsp; James Fisk and Jay Gould now made 
their appearance as Directors in the Erie Railway.&nbsp; The following is 
the New York <i>Tribune&rsquo;s</i> account of this affair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the crisis came, on the eve of the election for Directors, 
in October, 1867, there were three contestants in the field.&nbsp; Fisk was
serving under the Drew party, who wanted to be retained in office.&nbsp; 
Vanderbilt, master of Harlem, Hudson River, and Central, seemed to be on 
the point of securing Erie also.&nbsp; Eldridge was the leader of the 
Boston, Hartford, and Erie <!-- page 558--><a name="page558"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 558</span>party, which wanted to get into the Erie 
Directory for the purpose of making that Company guarantee the bonds of 
their own worthless road.&nbsp; Eldridge was assisted by Gould.&nbsp; As a 
result of the compromise by which the three opposing interests coalesced, 
Fisk and Gould were both chosen Directors of Erie, and from the month of 
October, 1867, dates the memorable association of these two choice spirits 
since so famous in the money markets of the world.&nbsp; They were not the 
counterparts, but the complements of each other.&nbsp; Fisk was bold, 
unscrupulous, dashing, enterprising, ready in execution, powerful in his 
influence over the lower and more sensual order of men.&nbsp; Gould was 
artful, reticent, long-headed, clear of brain, fertile of invention, 
tenacious of purpose, and no more burdened with unnecessary scruples than 
his more noisy and flashy companion.&nbsp; They were not long in joining 
fortunes.&nbsp; At the time of the famous Erie corner, the next March, they
were ostensibly working on opposite sides, Gould acting for Vanderbilt, and
Fisk being the man to whom Drew intrusted 50,000 shares of new stock, 
secretly issued, to be used when Vanderbilt&rsquo;s brokers began to 
buy.&nbsp; The mysteries of that transaction are fully known only to a few 
of the principal actors.&nbsp; An injuction of Judge Barnard&rsquo;s had 
forbidden Drew or anybody connected with the road to manufacture any more 
stock by the issue of convertible bonds.&nbsp; But Drew was 
&lsquo;short&rsquo; of Erie; the Vanderbilt pool threatened ruin; and stock
must be had.&nbsp; The new certificates had already been made out in the 
name of James Fisk, jr., and were in the hands of the Secretary who was 
enjoined from issuing them.&nbsp; Mr. Fisk saw a way out of the 
difficulty.&nbsp; The Secretary gave the certificate books to an 
employ&eacute; of the road, with directions to carry them carefully to the 
transfer office.&nbsp; The messenger returned in a moment empty-handed, and
told the astonished Secretary that Mr. Fisk had met him at the door, taken 
the books, and &lsquo;run away with them!&rsquo;&nbsp; On the same day the 
convertible bonds corresponding to these certificates were placed on the 
Secretary&rsquo;s desk, and as soon as Vanderbilt had forced up the price 
of Erie, Fisk&rsquo;s new shares were thrown upon the market, and bought by
Vanderbilt&rsquo;s agents before their origin <!-- page 559--><a 
name="page559"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 559</span>was suspected.&nbsp; 
Mr. Fisk unfortunately had not yet cultivated the intimate relations with 
Judge Barnard which he subsequently sustained.&nbsp; When the Drew party 
applied for an order from Judge Gilbert in Brooklyn, enjoining 
Barnard&rsquo;s injunctions, the petitioner who accused that ornament of 
the New York bench of a corrupt conspiracy to speculate in Erie stock, was 
none other than Fisk&rsquo;s partner, Mr. Belden.&nbsp; The next morning 
Barnard issued an order of arrest for contempt, and Fisk, with the whole 
Erie Directory, fled to Jersey City, carrying $7,000,000 of money and the 
books and papers of the Company.&nbsp; Among the most valuable of the 
assets transferred on that occasion to Taylor&rsquo;s Hotel was Miss Helen 
Josephine Mansfield.&nbsp; &lsquo;I went to Jersey,&rsquo; testified this 
fair creature some weeks ago, in the suit which has just come to so 
tragical a termination, &lsquo;with the officers of the Erie Company, and 
the railroad paid all the expense.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Fisk could afford to 
amuse himself.&nbsp; He had made fifty or sixty thousand dollars by his 
day&rsquo;s work in Broad street, and he had the satisfaction of knowing 
that he had not only beaten Vanderbilt and Barnard, but outwitted even his 
particular friend and patron, Mr. Drew.&nbsp; He had now practically the 
greater share of the management on his shoulders, though in name he was 
only Controller.&nbsp; He softened public indignation by subsidizing a gang
of ruffians, ostensibly in the Vanderbilt interest, to besiege &lsquo;Fort 
Taylor,&rsquo; as if for the purpose of kidnapping the Directors, and 
organizing a band of railway hands to mount guard about the hotel.&nbsp; He
dogged the steps of Mr. Drew, who was stealing over to New York by night to
make a secret compromise for himself alone with Mr. Vanderbilt, and when 
Drew carried off the funds of the Company, Fisk compelled him to bring them
back by putting an attachment on his money in bank.&nbsp; A bill was now 
introduced at Albany to legalize Drew&rsquo;s over-issue of stock.&nbsp; It
was defeated.&nbsp; Mr. Gould visited the capital with half a million 
dollars, and came back without a cent, and the bill which three weeks 
before had been rejected by a vote of 83 to 32 was carried by a vote of 101
to 6.&nbsp; This was followed by a general suspension of hostilities.&nbsp;
The scandalous network of injunctions had <!-- page 561--><a 
name="page561"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 561</span>become so intricate 
that one general order was obtained sweeping it all away.&nbsp; Judge 
Barnard was placated in some manner not made public.&nbsp; Mr. Peter B. 
Sweeny, who, as the representative of Tammany, had been appointed 
&lsquo;Receiver&rsquo; of the property of the railway company after it had 
been carried out of reach, was allowed $150,000 for his trouble of taking 
care of nothing; and the exiles returned to New York.&nbsp; In one of his 
characteristic fits of frankness, James Fisk afterward on the witness stand
described the settlement which ensued as an &lsquo;almighty 
robbery.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Directors of Erie took 50,000 shares of stock off
Vanderbilt&rsquo;s shoulders at 70, and gave him $1,000,000 besides.&nbsp; 
Eldridge got $4,000,000 of Erie acceptances in exchange for $5,000,000 of 
Boston, Hartford, and Erie, which became bankrupt very soon 
afterward.&nbsp; Drew kept all he had made, but was to pay $540,000 into 
the Erie treasury and stand acquitted of all claims the corporation might 
have against him.&nbsp; Nearly half a million more was required to pay the 
lawyers and discontinue the suits.&nbsp; Fisk, getting nothing personally, 
stood out against the arrangement until the conspirators consented to give 
him&mdash;the Erie Railroad!&nbsp; Drew and some others were to resign, and
Fisk and Gould to take possession of the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p560.jpg">
<img alt="JAY GOULD." src="images/p560.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Out of his first operations in Erie stock, Fisk is said to have made 
$1,300,000.&nbsp; The Legislature of New York legalized his acts, through 
the influence, it is said, of Mr. William M. Tweed.&nbsp; It is certain 
that this act was followed by the entrance of Tweed and Sweeny into the 
Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Once in possession of the Erie road, Fisk and his colleagues managed it 
in their own interests.&nbsp; It was commonly believed in the city that 
Fisk was but the executor of the designs which were conceived by an abler 
brain than his own.</p>
<p>He figured largely in the infamous Black Friday transactions of Wall 
street, and is credited by the public with being one of the originators of 
that vast conspiracy to destroy the business of the street.&nbsp; How near 
he came to success has already been shown.</p>
<p>Soon after coming into possession of the Erie road, he <!-- page 
562--><a name="page562"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 562</span>purchased 
Pike&rsquo;s Opera House for $1,000,000 in the name of the Erie Railway 
Company.&nbsp; The Directors, however, refused to approve the transaction, 
and he refunded to them the amount of the purchase, taking the building on 
his private account, and repaying the road in some of its stock owned by 
him.&nbsp; Subsequently he leased the front building to the road at an 
enormous rent, and opened for it a suite of the most gorgeous railway 
offices in the world.&nbsp; He subsequently bought the Fifth Avenue 
Theatre, and the Central Park Garden, and the Bristol line of steamers, and
the steamers plying in connection with the Long Branch Railway.&nbsp; He 
made himself &ldquo;Admiral&rdquo; of this magnificent fleet, and dressed 
himself in a gorgeous naval uniform.&nbsp; When President Grant visited the
Coliseum Concert at Boston, Fisk accompanied him in this dress, having 
previously played the part of host to the President during the voyage down 
the Sound on one of his boats.&nbsp; A year or two previous to his death, 
he was elected Colonel of the Ninth Regiment of the National Guard.</p>
<p>Previous to his purchase of the Grand Opera House, Mr. Fisk was an 
unknown man, but the ownership of this palatial establishment gave him an 
opportunity of enjoying the notoriety he coveted.&nbsp; His career in 
connection with this establishment, and his unscrupulous management of the 
Erie Railway, soon made him notorious in all parts of America and 
Europe.&nbsp; His monogram was placed on everything he owned or was 
connected with, and he literally lived in the gaze of the public.&nbsp; He 
can scarcely be said to have had any private life, for the whole town was 
talking of his theatres, his dashing four in hand, his railway and 
steamboats, his regiment, his toilettes, his magnificence, his reckless 
generosity, and his love affairs.&nbsp; He had little regard for morality 
or public sentiment, and hesitated at nothing necessary to the success of 
his schemes.&nbsp; His great passion was for notoriety, and he cared not 
what he did so it made people talk about him.&nbsp; He surrounded himself 
with a kind of barbaric splendor, which won him the name of the 
&ldquo;Prince of Erie.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of his acts were utterly 
ludicrous, and he had the wit to perceive it, but he cared not so it made 
James Fisk, jr., <!-- page 563--><a name="page563"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 563</span>the talk of the day.&nbsp; His influence upon 
the community was bad.&nbsp; He had not only his admirers, but his 
imitators, and these sought to reproduce his bad qualities rather than his 
virtues.</p>
<p>In some respects he was a strange compound of good and evil.&nbsp; He 
was utterly unprincipled, yet he was generous to a fault.&nbsp; No one ever
came to him in distress without meeting with assistance, and it adds to the
virtue of these good deeds that he never proclaimed them to the 
world.&nbsp; Says one of his intimate friends: &ldquo;His personal expenses
were, at a liberal estimate, not one-fifth as large as the amount which he 
spent in providing for persons in whose affairs he took a kindly interest, 
who had seen misfortune in life, and whom he felt to be dependent upon him 
for assistance.&nbsp; He gave away constantly enormous amounts in still 
more direct charities, concerning which he rarely spoke to any one, and it 
was only by accident that even his most intimate friends found out what he 
was doing.&nbsp; He supported for some years an entire family of blind 
persons without ever saying a word about it to his nearest friends.&nbsp; 
He was particularly generous towards actors and actresses, who, whenever 
they suffered from misfortune, would always appeal to him; and one lady, 
herself an actress of considerable repute and of very generous nature, was 
in the habit of coming constantly to Mr. Fisk to appeal to him for 
assistance to aged or unfortunate members of their profession, assistance 
which he never refused.&nbsp; Very recently a lady, who was formerly a New 
York favorite, but who made an unhappy marriage, and to escape from a 
drunken husband had carried her child to England, where, after struggling 
in provincial theatres for more than a year, she came to almost her last 
penny and had hardly the means to return to this country, without a change 
of clothing and without being able to bring away her child, made her case 
known to the lady before-mentioned, who immediately, after helping to the 
extent of her own scanty means, sent her with a note to Mr. Fisk.&nbsp; Mr.
Fisk listened to her story, advanced her $250 on the spot, procured her an 
engagement in a theatre at $75 a week, and interested the captain of one of
our finest sea-going vessels in the case so far as to provide <!-- page 
564--><a name="page564"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 564</span>a free 
passage for the child to this country, the captain, in order to please Mr. 
Fisk, taking great pains to discover the whereabouts of the child and 
restore her to its mother.&nbsp; These are but incidental illustrations of 
what Mr. Fisk was daily doing, and always doing with the utmost privacy and
with the greatest reluctance to allow it to become known.&nbsp; He would 
rarely subscribe to any public charity, because he disliked to make any 
pretence of liberality before the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fall of 1867, Fisk made the acquaintance of Mrs. Helen Josephine 
Mansfield, an actress, who had just been divorced from her husband, Frank 
Lawler.&nbsp; He became deeply enamored of her, and she became his mistress
and lived with him several years, her main object being, it would seem, to 
obtain from him all the money he was willing to expend upon her.&nbsp; Fisk
subsequently introduced one of his friends, Edward S. Stokes, to Mrs. 
Mansfield, and the woman was not long in transferring her affections from 
her protector to Stokes.&nbsp; This aroused Fisk&rsquo;s jealousy, and led 
to constant trouble between his mistress and himself.&nbsp; His quarrel 
with Stokes was complicated by business disputes, which were carried into 
the courts, where Fisk was all powerful.&nbsp; The matter went from bad to 
worse, until at length Stokes and Mrs. Mansfield instituted a libel suit 
against Fisk, which was commonly regarded in the city as simply an attempt 
on their part to extort money from him.&nbsp; The suit dragged its slow way
through the court in which it was instituted, and every day diminished the 
chances of the success of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>For reasons which he has not yet made public, Stokes now resolved to 
take matters into his own hands, and on the afternoon of the 6th of 
January, 1872, waylaid Fisk, as the latter was ascending the private 
stairway of the Grand Central Hotel, and, firing upon him twice from his 
hiding place, inflicted on him severe wounds from which he died the next 
day.&nbsp; The assassination was most cowardly and brutal, and awakened a 
feeling of horror and indignation on the part of all classes.</p>
<h2><!-- page 565--><a name="page565"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
565</span>XLVII.&nbsp; TRINITY CHURCH.</h2>
<p>On the west side of Broadway, facing Wall street, stands Trinity Church,
or, as it is commonly called, &ldquo;Old Trinity,&rdquo; the handsomest 
ecclesiastical structure in the city.&nbsp; It is the third edifice which 
has occupied the site.&nbsp; The first church was built in 1697, at the 
organization of the parish, and was a plain square edifice with an ugly 
steeple.&nbsp; In 1776, this building was destroyed in the great fire of 
that year.&nbsp; A second church was built on the site of the old one, in 
1790.&nbsp; In 1839, this was pulled down, and the present noble edifice 
was erected.&nbsp; It was finished and consecrated in 1846.</p>
<p>The present church is a beautiful structure of brown-stone, built as 
nearly in the pure Gothic style as modern churches ever are.&nbsp; The 
walls are fifty feet in height, and the apex of the roof is sixty feet from
the floor of the church.&nbsp; The interior is finished in brown-stone, 
with massive columns of the same material supporting the roof.&nbsp; There 
are no transepts, but it is proposed to enlarge the church by the addition 
of transepts, and to extend the choir back to the end of the 
churchyard.&nbsp; The nave and the aisles make up the public portion of the
church.&nbsp; The choir is occupied by the clergy.&nbsp; The windows are of
stained glass.&nbsp; Those at the sides are very simple, but the oriel over
the altar is a grand work.&nbsp; There are two organs, a monster instrument
over the main entrance, and a smaller organ in the choir.&nbsp; Both are 
remarkably fine instruments.&nbsp; The vestry rooms, which lie on each side
of the chancel, contain a number of handsome memorial tablets, and in the 
north room there is a fine tomb in memory of Bishop Onderdonk, with a 
full-length effigy of the deceased prelate in his episcopal robes.</p>
<p><!-- page 566--><a name="page566"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
566</span>Service is held twice a day in the church.&nbsp; On Sundays and 
high feast days there is full service and a sermon.&nbsp; The choral 
service is used altogether on such occasions.&nbsp; Trinity has long been 
famous for its excellent music.&nbsp; The choir consists of men and boys, 
who are trained with great care by the musical director.&nbsp; The service 
is very beautiful and impressive, and is thoroughly in keeping with the 
grand and cathedral-like edifice in which it is conducted.&nbsp; The two 
organs, the voices of the choristers, and often the chime of bells, all 
combine to send a flood of melody rolling through the beautiful arches such
as is never heard elsewhere in the city.</p>
<p>The spire is 284 feet in height, and is built of solid brownstone from 
the base to the summit of the cross.&nbsp; It contains a clock, with three 
faces, just above the roof of the church, and a chime of bells.&nbsp; About
110 feet from the ground the square form of the tower terminates, and a 
massive but graceful octagonal spire rises to a height of 174 feet.&nbsp; 
At the base of this spire is a narrow gallery enclosed with a stone 
balustrade, from which a fine view of the city and the surrounding country 
is obtained.&nbsp; The visitor may, however, climb within the spire to a 
point nearly two hundred and fifty feet from the street.&nbsp; Here is a 
small wooden platform, and about four feet above it are four small windows 
through which one may look out upon the magnificent view spread out below 
him.&nbsp; The eye can range over the entire city, and take in Brooklyn and
its suburban towns as well.&nbsp; To the eastward are Long Island Sound and
the distant hills of Connecticut.&nbsp; To the southward stretches away the
glorious bay, and beyond it is the dark blue line of the Atlantic.&nbsp; 
Sandy Hook, the Highlands, the Narrows, and Staten Island are all in full 
view.&nbsp; To the westward is the New Jersey shore, and back of Jersey 
city rise the blue Orange Mountains, with Newark, Elizabeth, Orange and 
Patterson in full sight.&nbsp; To the northward, the Hudson stretches away 
until it seems to disappear in the dark shadow of the Palisades.&nbsp; From
where you stand, you look down on the habitations of nearly three millions 
of people.&nbsp; The bay, the rivers, and the distant Sound are crowded 
with vessels of all kinds.&nbsp; If the day be clear, you may <!-- page 
567--><a name="page567"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 567</span>see the 
railway trains dashing across the meadows back of Jersey City.&nbsp; The 
roar of the great city comes up to you from below, and beneath you is a 
perfect maze of telegraph wires.&nbsp; The people in the streets seem like 
pigmies, and the vehicles are like so many toys.&nbsp; You know they are 
moving rapidly, but they seem from this lofty height to be crawling.&nbsp; 
It is a long way to these upper windows, but the view which they command is
worth the exertion.&nbsp; The tower is open to visitors during the week, on
payment of a trifling fee to the sexton.</p>
<p>The chimes are hung in the square tower, just above the roof of the 
church.&nbsp; The bells are nine in number.&nbsp; The smallest weighs 
several hundred pounds, while the largest weighs several thousand.&nbsp; 
The musical range is an octave and a quarter, rather a limited scale, it is
true, but the ringer is a thorough musician, and has managed to ring out 
many an air within this compass, which but for his ingenuity would have 
been unsuited to these bells.&nbsp; The largest bell, the &ldquo;Big 
Ben,&rdquo; and several others, are connected with the clock, and the 
former strikes the hours, while the rest of this set chime the 
quarters.&nbsp; Five of the bells, the large one and the four smaller ones,
were brought here from England, in 1846.&nbsp; The other four were made in 
West Troy, by Meneely &amp; Son, a few years later, and are fully equal to 
their English mates in tone and compass.&nbsp; The entire chime is very 
rich and sweet in tone, and, in this respect, is surpassed by very few 
bells in the world.&nbsp; The bells are hung on swinging frames, but are 
lashed, so as to stand motionless during the chiming, the notes being 
struck by the tongues, which are movable.&nbsp; The tongue always strikes 
in the same place, and thus the notes are full and regular.&nbsp; From the 
tongue of each bell there is a cord which is attached to a wooden lever in 
the ringer&rsquo;s room, about thirty feet below.&nbsp; These nine levers 
are arranged side by side, and are so arranged as to work as easy as 
possible.&nbsp; Each is as large as a handspike, and it requires no little 
strength to sustain the exertion of working them.&nbsp; The ringer places 
his music before him, and strikes each note as it occurs by suddenly 
pushing down the proper lever.&nbsp; At the end of his work, he is 
thoroughly tired.&nbsp; The ringer now in charge of the bells is Mr. James 
Ayliffe, an accomplished musician.</p>
<p><!-- page 568--><a name="page568"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
568</span>In favorable weather, the chimes can be heard for a distance of 
from five to ten miles.&nbsp; There are few strangers who leave the city 
without hearing the sweet bells of the old church.&nbsp; The city people 
would count it a great misfortune to be deprived of their music.&nbsp; For 
nearly thirty years they have heard them, in seasons of joy and in hours of
sadness.&nbsp; On Christmas eve, at midnight, the chimes ring in the 
blessed morning of our Lord&rsquo;s nativity, thus continuing an old and 
beautiful custom now observed only in parts of Europe.</p>
<p>The church is kept open from early morning until sunset.&nbsp; In the 
winter season it is always well heated, and hundreds of the poor find 
warmth and shelter within its holy walls.&nbsp; It is the only church in 
New York in which there is no distinction made between the rich and the 
poor.&nbsp; The writer has frequently seen beggars in tatters conducted, by
the sexton, to the best seats in the church.</p>
<p>The rector and his assistants are alive to the fact that this is one of 
the few churches now left to the lower part of the city, and they strive to
make it a great missionary centre.&nbsp; Their best efforts are for the 
poor.&nbsp; Those who sneer at the wealth of the parish, would do well to 
trouble themselves to see what a good use is made of it.</p>
<p>The ultra fashionable element of the congregation attend Trinity Chapel,
or &ldquo;Up-town Trinity,&rdquo; in Twenty-fifth street, near 
Broadway.&nbsp; This is a handsome church, and has a large and wealthy 
congregation.</p>
<p>Trinity Parish embraces a large part of the city.&nbsp; It includes the 
following churches, or chapels, as they are called: St. Paul&rsquo;s, St. 
John&rsquo;s, Trinity Chapel, and Trinity Church.&nbsp; It is in charge of 
a rector, who is a sort of small bishop in this little diocese.&nbsp; He 
has eight assistants.&nbsp; Each church or chapel has its pastor, who is 
subject to the supervision of the rector.&nbsp; The Rev. Morgan Dix, D.D., 
a son of General John A. Dix, is the present rector.</p>
<p>Trinity takes good care of its clergy.&nbsp; The salaries are amply 
sufficient to insure a comfortable support, and a well-furnished house is 
provided for each one who has a family.&nbsp; Should a clergyman <!-- page 
570--><a name="page570"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 570</span>become 
superannuated in the service of the parish, he is liberally maintained 
during his life; and should he die in his ministry, provision is made for 
his family.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p569.jpg">
<img alt="TRINITY CHURCH." src="images/p569.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The wealth of the parish is very great.&nbsp; It is variously stated at 
from sixty to one hundred millions of dollars.&nbsp; It is chiefly in real 
estate, the leases of which yield an immense revenue.</p>
<p>The churchyard of Old Trinity covers about two acres of ground.&nbsp; A 
handsome iron railing separates it from Broadway, and the thick rows of 
gravestones, all crumbling and stained with age, present a strange contrast
to the bustle, vitality, and splendor with which they are surrounded.&nbsp;
They stare solemnly down into Wall street, and offer a bitter commentary 
upon the struggles and anxiety of the money kings.</p>
<p>The place has an air of peace that is pleasant in the midst of so much 
noise and confusion, and is well worth visiting.</p>
<p>In the churchyard, near the south door of the church, you will see a 
plain brown-stone slab, bearing this inscription: &ldquo;<i>The vault of 
Walter and Robert C. Livingston</i>, <i>sons of Robert Livingston</i>, 
<i>of the Manor of Livingston</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is one of the Meccas 
of the world of science, for the mortal part of <i>Robert Fulton</i> sleeps
in the vault below, in sight of the mighty steam fleets which his genius 
has called into existence.&nbsp; A plain obelisk, near the centre of the 
southern extremity of the yard, marks the grave of Alexander 
Hamilton.&nbsp; At the west end of the south side of the church is the 
sarcophagus of Albert Gallatin, and James Lawrence, the heroic but 
ill-fated commander of the <i>Chesapeake</i> sleeps close by the south door
of the church, his handsome tomb being the most prominent object in that 
portion of the yard.&nbsp; At the northern extremity of the churchyard, and
within a few feet of Broadway, is the splendid &ldquo;Martyrs&rsquo; 
Monument,&rdquo; erected to the memory of the patriots of the American 
Revolution, who died from the effects of British cruelty in the &ldquo;Old 
Sugar House&rdquo; and in the prison ships in Wallabout Bay, the site of 
the present Brooklyn Navy Yard.</p>
<p>Close to the Broadway railing, and so close that one can almost touch it
from the street, is a worn brown-stone slab, bearing but two words, 
&ldquo;Charlotte Temple.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is difficult to find, <!-- page 
571--><a name="page571"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 571</span>and but few 
strangers ever see it, but for years it has been the most prominent spot in
the enclosure to the lovers of romance.&nbsp; Charlotte Temple&rsquo;s 
history is a very sad one, and unhappily not a rare one.&nbsp; She lived 
and died nearly a century ago.&nbsp; She was young and surpassingly lovely,
and she attracted the attention of a British officer of high rank, who 
carried her off from her boarding school, seduced her, and deserted 
her.&nbsp; Her friends discarded her, and she sank under her heavy load of 
sorrow.&nbsp; She was found by her father in a wretched garret, with her 
child.&nbsp; Both were at the point of death.&nbsp; The father came just in
time to close their eyes forever.&nbsp; They were laid to rest in the same 
grave in the old churchyard, and, some years after, the seducer, stung with
remorse for his brutality, placed over them the slab which still marks the 
spot.&nbsp; The sad story was written out in book form, and was dramatized

572</span>XLVIII.&nbsp; THE HOLIDAYS.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; NEW YEAR&rsquo;S DAY.</h3>
<p>All the holidays are observed in New York with more or less heartiness, 
but those which claim especial attention are New Year&rsquo;s Day and 
Christmas.</p>
<p>The observance of New Year&rsquo;s Day dates from the earliest 
times.&nbsp; The Dutch settlers brought the custom from their old homes 
across the sea, and made the day an occasion for renewing old friendships 
and wishing each other well.&nbsp; All feuds were forgotten, family 
breaches were repaired, and every one made it a matter of conscience to 
enter upon the opening year with kind feelings towards his neighbor.&nbsp; 
Subsequent generations have continued to observe the custom, though 
differently from the primitive but hearty style of their fathers.</p>
<p>For weeks before the New Year dawns, nearly every house in the city is 
in a state of confusion.&nbsp; The whole establishment is thoroughly 
overhauled and cleaned, and neither mistress nor maid has any rest from her
labors.&nbsp; The men folks are nuisances at such times, and gradually keep
themselves out of the way, lest they should interfere with the 
cleaning.&nbsp; Persons who contemplate refurnishing their houses, 
generally wait until near the close of the year before doing so, in order 
that everything may be new on the great day.&nbsp; Those who cannot 
refurnish, endeavor to make their establishments look as fresh and new as 
possible.&nbsp; A general baking, brewing, stewing, broiling, <!-- page 
573--><a name="page573"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 573</span>and frying 
is begun, and the pantries are loaded with good things to eat and to 
drink.</p>
<p>All the family must have new outfits for the occasion, and tailors and 
modistes find this a profitable season.&nbsp; To be seen in a dress that 
has ever been worn before, is considered the height of vulgarity.</p>
<p>The table is set in magnificent style.&nbsp; Elegant china and 
glassware, and splendid plate, adorn it.&nbsp; It is loaded down with 
dainties of every description.&nbsp; Wines, lemonades, coffee, brandy, 
whiskey and punch are in abundance.&nbsp; Punch is seen in all its glory on
this day, and each householder strives to have the best of this 
article.&nbsp; There are regular punch-makers in the city, who reap a 
harvest at this time.&nbsp; Their services are engaged long before-hand, 
and they are kept busy all the morning going from house to house, to make 
this beverage, which is nowhere so palatable as in this city.</p>
<p>Hairdressers, or &ldquo;<i>artistes</i> in hair,&rdquo; as they call 
themselves, are also in demand at New Year, for each lady then wishes to 
have her <i>coiffure</i> as magnificent as possible.&nbsp; This is a day of
hard work to these <i>artistes</i>, and in order to meet all their 
engagements, they begin their rounds at midnight.&nbsp; They are punctual 
to the moment, and from that time until noon on New Year&rsquo;s Day are 
busily engaged.&nbsp; Of course those whose heads are dressed at such 
unseasonable hours cannot think of lying down to sleep, as their 
&ldquo;head-gear&rdquo; would be ruined by such a procedure.&nbsp; They are
compelled to rest sitting bolt upright, or with their heads resting on a 
table or the back of a chair.</p>
<p>All New York is stirring by eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; By
nine the streets are filled with gayly-dressed persons on their way to make
their annual calls.&nbsp; Private carriages, hacks, and other vehicles soon
appear, filled with persons bent upon similar expeditions.&nbsp; Business 
is entirely suspended in the city.&nbsp; The day is a legal holiday, and is
faithfully observed by all classes.&nbsp; Hack hire is enormous&mdash;forty
or fifty dollars being sometimes paid for a carriage for the day.&nbsp; The
cars and omnibuses are crowded, and every one is in the highest 
spirits.&nbsp; The crowds consist entirely of men.&nbsp; Scarcely a female 
is seen on the <!-- page 574--><a name="page574"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 574</span>streets.&nbsp; It is not considered 
respectable for a lady to venture out, and the truth is, it is not prudent 
for her to do so.</p>
<p>Callers begin their rounds at ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The ultra 
fashionables do not receive until twelve.&nbsp; At the proper time, the 
lady of the house, attended by her daughters, if there be any, takes her 
stand in the drawing-room by the hospitable board.&nbsp; In a little while 
the door-bell rings, and the first visitor is ushered in by the pompous 
domestic in charge of the door.&nbsp; The first callers are generally young
men, who are ambitious to make as many visits as possible.&nbsp; The old 
hands know where the best tables are set, and confine their attentions 
principally to them.&nbsp; The caller salutes the hostess and the ladies 
present, says it&rsquo;s a fine or a bad day, as the case may be, offers 
the compliments of the season, and accepts with alacrity the invitation of 
the hostess to partake of the refreshments.&nbsp; A few eatables are 
swallowed in haste&mdash;the visitor managing to get out a word or two 
between each mouthful&mdash;a glass of wine or punch is gulped down, the 
visitor bows himself out, and the ladies avenge themselves for the 
infliction by ridiculing him after he has gone.&nbsp; This is the routine, 
and it goes on all day, and until long after dark.</p>
<p>Sometimes a family, not wishing to receive callers, will hang a 
card-basket on the front-door knob and close the front of the house.&nbsp; 
The callers deposit their cards in the basket, and go their way 
rejoicing.&nbsp; Perhaps the mansion is one that is famed for the 
excellence of its wines and eatables on such occasions.&nbsp; The veteran 
caller has promised himself a genuine treat here, and he views the basket 
with dismay.&nbsp; There is no help for it, however, so he deposits his 
card, and departs, wondering at &ldquo;the manners of some people who 
refuse to observe a time-honored custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p575.jpg">
<img alt="NEW YEAR&rsquo;S CALLS." src="images/p575.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>A gentleman in starting out, provides himself with a written memorandum 
of the places he intends visiting, and &ldquo;checks&rdquo; each one off 
with his pencil, when the call is made.&nbsp; This list is necessary, as 
few sober men can remember all their friends without it, and with the 
majority the list is a necessity before the day is half over.&nbsp; The 
driver takes charge of it often, and <!-- page 576--><a 
name="page576"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 576</span>when the caller is 
too hazy to act for himself, carries him sometimes to the door of the 
house, and rings the bell for him.&nbsp; Each man tries to make as many 
calls as possible, so that he may boast of the feat afterwards.&nbsp; At 
the outset, of course, everything is conducted with the utmost propriety, 
but, as the day wears on, the generous liquors they have imbibed begin to 
&ldquo;tell&rdquo; upon the callers, and many eccentricities, to use no 
harsher term, are the result.&nbsp; Towards the close of the day, 
everything is in confusion&mdash;the door-bell is never silent.&nbsp; 
Crowds of young men, in various stages of intoxication, rush into the 
lighted parlors, leer at the hostess in the vain effort to offer their 
respects, call for liquor, drink it, and stagger out, to repeat the scene 
at some other house.&nbsp; Frequently, they are unable to recognize the 
residences of their friends, and stagger into the wrong house.&nbsp; Some 
fall early in the day, and are put to bed by their friends; others sink 
down helpless at the feet of their hostess, and are sent home; and a few 
manage to get through the day.&nbsp; Strange as it may seem, it is no 
disgrace to get drunk on New Year&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; These indiscretions 
are expected at such times; and it has happened that some of the ladies 
themselves have succumbed to the seductive influences of 
&ldquo;punch,&rdquo; and have been carried to bed by the servants.</p>
<p>The Kitchen, as well as the parlor, observes the day.&nbsp; During the 
Christmas week housekeepers become impressed with the fact that the usual 
amount of provisions utterly fails to meet the wants of the family.&nbsp; 
They attribute it to the increased appetites of the establishment.&nbsp; 
Biddy could tell a different tale, however, and on New Year&rsquo;s Day 
sets a fine table for her &ldquo;Cousins&rdquo; and friends, at the expense
of the master of the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shure, she must say her friends, 
as well as the missus; and bedad, it&rsquo;s a free counthry, and a poor 
ghirl has to look out for hersilf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day one half of New York has a headache, and the other half is 
&ldquo;used up&rdquo; with fatigue.&nbsp; The doctors are kept busy, and so
are the police courts.&nbsp; This day is commonly called &ldquo;The 
Ladies&rsquo; Day,&rdquo; and is devoted by those who feel <!-- page 
577--><a name="page577"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 577</span>inclined, to
making calls on each other and comparing notes as to the work of the 
previous day.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; CHRISTMAS.</h3>
<p>For weeks before the high festival of Christendom, New York puts on its 
holiday attire.&nbsp; The stores are filled with the richest and most 
attractive goods, toys of every description fill up every available space 
in the great thoroughfares, the markets and provision stores abound in good
things in the eatable line, and the whole city looks brighter and more 
cheerful than it has done since the last Christmas season.&nbsp; Broadway 
and the Bowery are ablaze with gaslight at night, and shops that usually 
close their doors at dark, remain open until nine or ten 
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; All are crowded, and millions of dollars are spent in 
providing for the happy day.&nbsp; On Christmas Eve, or perhaps a day or 
two later, many of the churches provide Christmas trees for their Sunday 
schools.</p>
<p>When the bell of &ldquo;Old Trinity&rdquo; rings out the last stroke of 
the midnight hour of Christmas Eve, there is a pause.&nbsp; The city is 
dark and still, and there is not a sound in all the vast edifice which 
towers so majestically in the gloom of the night.&nbsp; The heavy clangor 
of the clock bell dies away in the stillness, when suddenly there bursts 
out from the dark tower of the old church a perfect flood of melody.&nbsp; 
The bells seem beside themselves with joy, and they send their merry tones 
rolling through the silent streets below, and out upon the blue waters of 
the bay, bidding all men rejoice, for Christ is born.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day the festivities are much the same as those in other 
places.&nbsp; They are hearty and merry here, as elsewhere, and the season 
is one of happiness.&nbsp; The poor are not forgotten.&nbsp; Those who give
nothing at other times, will subscribe for dinners or clothing for the 
unfortunate at Christmas.&nbsp; The various charitable institutions are 
kept busy receiving and delivering the presents sent them.&nbsp; Their 
inmates are <!-- page 578--><a name="page578"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
578</span>provided with plentiful, substantial dinners, and have abundant 
means of sharing in the happiness which seems to pervade the whole 
city.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving Day, Evacuation Day (November 25th), the Fourth of July, 
and the Birthday of Washington, all receive appropriate honors, but they do
not compare with the two great festivals of the Metropolis.</p>
<h2><!-- page 579--><a name="page579"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
579</span>XLIX.&nbsp; THE SOCIAL EVIL.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE LOST SISTERHOOD.</h3>
<p>In January, 1866, Bishop Simpson, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, at 
a public meeting at the Cooper Institute, made the astounding declaration 
that there were as many prostitutes in the city of New York as there were 
members of the Methodist Church, the membership of which at that time was 
estimated at between eleven and twelve thousand.&nbsp; In the spring of 
1871, the Rev. Dr. Bellows estimated the number of these women at 
20,000.&nbsp; These declarations were repeated all over the country by the 
press, and New York was held up to public rebuke as a second Sodom.&nbsp; 
The estimate of Dr. Bellows would brand one female in every twenty-four, of
all ages, as notoriously impure, and taking away from the actual population
those too old and too young to be included in this class, the per centage 
would be, according to that gentleman, very much larger&mdash;something 
like one in every eighteen or twenty.&nbsp; New York is bad enough in this 
respect, but not so bad as the gentlemen we have named suppose.&nbsp; The 
real facts are somewhat difficult to ascertain.&nbsp; The police 
authorities boast that they have full information as to the inmates of 
every house of ill-fame in the city, but their published statistics are 
notoriously inaccurate.&nbsp; As near as can be ascertained, there are 
about 600 houses of ill-fame in the city.&nbsp; The number of women living 
in them, and those frequenting the bed-houses and lower class assignation 
houses, is about 5000.&nbsp; In this estimate is included about 700 
waiter-girls in the concert saloons.</p>
<p><!-- page 580--><a name="page580"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
580</span>This is the number of professional women of the town, but it does
not include these who, while nominally virtuous, really live upon the wages
of their shame, or the nominally respectable married and single women who 
occasionally visit assignation houses.&nbsp; It is impossible to estimate 
these, but it is believed that the number is proportionately small.&nbsp; 
Their sin is known only to themselves and their lovers, and they do not 
figure in the police records as abandoned women.</p>
<p>The fallen women of New York include every grade of their class, from 
those who are living in luxury, to the poor wretches who are dying by 
inches in the slums.&nbsp; Every stage of the road to ruin is 
represented.</p>
<p>There are not many first-class houses of ill-fame in the 
city&mdash;probably not over fifty in all&mdash;but they are located in the
best neighborhoods, and it is said that Fifth avenue itself is not free 
from the taint of their presence.&nbsp; As a rule, they are hired fully 
furnished, the owners being respectable and often wealthy people.&nbsp; The
finest of these houses command from ten to twelve thousand dollars 
rent.&nbsp; The neighbors do not suspect the true character of the place, 
unless some of them happen to be among its visitors.&nbsp; The police soon 
discover the truth, however.&nbsp; The establishment is palatial in its 
character, and is conducted with the most rigid outward propriety.</p>
<p>The proprietress is generally a middle-aged woman, of fine personal 
appearance.&nbsp; She has a man living with her, who passes as her husband,
in order that she may be able to show a legal protector in case of trouble 
with the authorities.&nbsp; This couple usually assume some foreign name, 
and pass themselves off upon the unsuspecting as persons of the highest 
respectability.</p>
<p>The inmates are usually young women, or women in the prime of 
life.&nbsp; They are carefully chosen for their beauty and charms, and are 
frequently persons of education and refinement.&nbsp; They are required to 
observe the utmost decorum in the parlors of the house, and their toilettes
are exquisite and modest.&nbsp; They never make acquaintances on the 
street, and, indeed, have no need to do so.&nbsp; The women who fill these 
houses are generally of respectable origin.&nbsp; They are the daughters, 
often the wives <!-- page 581--><a name="page581"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 581</span>or widows, of persons of the best social 
position.&nbsp; Some have been drawn astray by villains; some have been 
drugged and ruined, and have fled to these places to hide their shame from 
their friends; some have adopted the life in order to avoid poverty, their 
means having been suddenly swept away; some have entered upon it from 
motives of extravagance and vanity; some are married women, who have been 
unfaithful to their husbands, and who have been deserted in consequence; 
some have been ruined by the cruelty and neglect of their husbands; some, 
horrible as it may seem, have been forced into such a life by their 
parents; and others have adopted the life from motives of pure 
licentiousness.&nbsp; The proprietress takes care to keep her house full, 
and has agents whose business it is to provide her with fresh women as fast
as they are needed.&nbsp; Whatever may be the cause of their fall, these 
houses are always full of women competent to grace the best circles of 
social life.</p>
<p>The visitors to these establishments are men of means.&nbsp; No one can 
afford to visit them who has not money to spend on them.&nbsp; Besides the 
money paid to the inmates, the visitors expend large sums for wines.&nbsp; 
The liquors furnished are of an inferior quality, and the price is nearly 
double that of the best retail houses in the city.&nbsp; It is not pleasant
to contemplate, but it is nevertheless a fact, that the visitors include 
some of the leading men of the country, men high in public life, and 
eminent for their professional abilities.&nbsp; Even ministers of the 
gospel visiting the city have been seen at these houses.&nbsp; The 
proportion of married men is frightfully large.&nbsp; There is scarcely a 
night that does not witness the visits of numbers of husbands and fathers 
to these infamous palaces of sin.&nbsp; These same men would be merciless 
in their resentment of any lapse of virtue on the part of their 
wives.&nbsp; New York is not alone to blame for this.&nbsp; The city is 
full of strangers, and they contribute largely to the support of these 
places, and the city is called upon to bear the odium of their 
conduct.&nbsp; Men coming to New York from other parts of the country seem 
to think themselves freed from all the restraints of morality and religion,
and while here commit acts of dissipation and sin, such as they would not 
dream <!-- page 582--><a name="page582"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
582</span>of indulging in in their own communities, and they go home and 
denounce New York as the worst place in the world.</p>
<p>The proprietress takes care that the visitors shall enjoy all the 
privacy they desire.&nbsp; If one wishes to avoid the other visitors, he is
shown into a private room.&nbsp; Should the visitor desire an interview 
with any particular person he is quickly admitted to her presence.&nbsp; If
his visit is &ldquo;general,&rdquo; he awaits in the parlor the entrance of
the inmates of the house, who drop in at intervals.</p>
<p>The earnings of the inmates of these houses are very large, but their 
expenses are in proportion.&nbsp; They are charged the most exorbitant 
board by the proprietress, whose only object is to get all the money out of
them she can.&nbsp; They are obliged to dress handsomely, and their wants 
are numerous, so that they save nothing.&nbsp; The proprietress cares for 
them faithfully as long as they are of use to her, but she is not 
disinterested, as a rule, and turns them out of doors without mercy in case
of sickness or loss of beauty.</p>
<p>The inmates of these first-class houses remain in them about one 
year.&nbsp; Many go from them sooner.&nbsp; In entering upon their sin, and
tasting the sweets of wealth and luxury, they form false estimates of the 
life that lies before them, and imagine that though others have failed, 
they will always be able to retain their places in the aristocracy of 
shame.&nbsp; They are mistaken.&nbsp; The exceptions to the rule are very 
rare, so that we are warranted in asserting that these first-class houses 
change their inmates every year.&nbsp; A life of shame soon makes havoc 
with a woman&rsquo;s freshness, if not with her beauty, and the 
proprietress has no use for faded women.&nbsp; She knows the attraction of 
&ldquo;strange women,&rdquo; and she makes frequent changes as a matter of 
policy.&nbsp; Furthermore, the privacy of these places demands that the 
women shall be as little known to the general public as possible.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the reason, the change is inevitable.&nbsp; One year of 
luxury and pleasure, and then the woman begins her downward course.&nbsp; 
The next step is to a second-class house, where the proprietress is more 
cruel and exacting, and where <!-- page 583--><a name="page583"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 583</span>the visitors are rougher and ruder than those 
who frequented the place in which the lost one began her career.&nbsp; Two 
or three years in these houses is the average, and by this time the woman 
has become a thorough prostitute.&nbsp; She has lost her refinement, and, 
it may be, has added drunkenness to her other sin, and has become 
full-mouthed and reckless.&nbsp; She has sunk too low to be fit for even 
such a place as this, and she is turned out without pity to take the next 
step in her ruin.&nbsp; Greene street, with its horrible bagnios, claims 
her next.&nbsp; She becomes the companion of thieves&mdash;perhaps a thief 
herself&mdash;and passes her days in misery.&nbsp; She is a slave to her 
employer, and is robbed of her wretched earnings.&nbsp; Disease and 
sickness are her lot, and from them she cannot escape.&nbsp; She is never 
by any chance the companion of a &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; man, but her 
associates are as degraded as herself.&nbsp; She may fall into the hands of
the police, and be sent to the Island, where the seal is set to her 
damnation.&nbsp; A year or two in a Greene street house is all that a human
being can stand.&nbsp; The next descent is to Water street or some kindred 
thoroughfare.&nbsp; Almost immediately she falls a victim to the terrible 
scourge of these places.&nbsp; Disease of the most loathsome kind fastens 
itself upon her, and she literally rots to death.&nbsp; Such faces as look 
out upon you from those Water street dens!&nbsp; Foul, bloated with gin and
disease, distorted with suffering and despair, the poor creatures do what 
they can to hasten their sure doom.&nbsp; It all happens in a few years, 
seven or eight at the longest.&nbsp; Ninety-nine women out of every hundred
go down the fearful road I have marked out.&nbsp; I care not how beautiful,
how attractive, how sanguine may be the woman who is to-day the 
acknowledged belle of a fashionable house of ill-fame, her doom is 
sure.&nbsp; Would you see her seven years hence, should she live that long,
you must seek her among the living corpses of the Water street dens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wages of sin is death!&rdquo;&nbsp; Never were truer words 
written.&nbsp; Ask any one whose duties have called him into constant 
contact with the shadowy side of city life, and he will tell you that there
is no escape from the doom of the fallen women.&nbsp; Let <!-- page 
584--><a name="page584"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 584</span>no woman 
deceive herself.&nbsp; Once entered upon a life of shame, however brilliant
the opening may be, the end is certain, unless she anticipates it by 
suicide.&nbsp; The longer her life, the greater her suffering.&nbsp; It is 
very hard for a woman to reform from such a life.&nbsp; Not one in a 
hundred feels the desire to reform.&nbsp; Everything is against her.&nbsp; 
Her mode of life is utterly destructive of her better nature, her higher 
impulses.&nbsp; There is but one means of safety.&nbsp; Avoid the first 
step.&nbsp; There is no turning back, when once a woman enters upon the 
downward path.&nbsp; &ldquo;The wages of sin is death!&rdquo;&mdash;death 
in its most awful form.</p>
<p>It is generally very hard to learn the true history of these 
unfortunates.&nbsp; As a rule, they have lively imaginations, and rarely 
confine themselves to facts.&nbsp; All wish to excite the sympathy of those
to whom they speak, and make themselves as irresponsible for their fall as 
possible.&nbsp; It is safe to assert that the truly unfortunate are the 
exceptions.&nbsp; Women of cultivation and refinement are exceptionally 
rare in this grade of life.&nbsp; The majority were of humble position 
originally, and either deliberately adopted or allowed themselves to be led
into the life as a means of escaping poverty and gratifying a love for fine
clothes and display.&nbsp; The greater part of these women begin their 
careers at second and third class houses, and, as a matter of course, their
descent into the depths is all the more rapid.&nbsp; Very many are led 
astray through their ignorance, and by the persuasions of their 
acquaintances engaged in the same wretched business.&nbsp; The proprietors 
of these houses, of every class, spare no pains to draw into their nets all
the victims that can he ensnared.&nbsp; They have their agents scattered 
all over the country, who use every means to tempt young girls to come to 
the great city to engage in this life of shame.&nbsp; They promise them 
money, fine clothes, ease, and an elegant home.&nbsp; The seminaries and 
rural districts of the land furnish a large proportion of this class.&nbsp;
The hotels in this city are closely watched by the agents of these infamous
establishments, especially hotels of the plainer and less expensive 
kind.&nbsp; These harpies watch their chance, and when they lay siege to a 
blooming young girl, surround her with every species of enticement.&nbsp; 
She is taken to church, <!-- page 585--><a name="page585"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 585</span>to places of amusement, or to the park, and, 
in returning, a visit is paid to the house of a friend of the harpy.&nbsp; 
Refreshments are offered, and a glass of drugged wine plunges the victim 
into a stupor, from which she awakes a ruined woman.</p>
<p>A large number of the fallen women of this city are from New 
England.&nbsp; The excess of the female population in that overcrowded 
section of the country makes it impossible for all to find husbands, and 
throws many upon their own resources for their support.&nbsp; There is not 
room for all at home, and hundreds come every year to this city.&nbsp; They
are ignorant of the difficulty of finding employment here, but soon learn 
it by experience.&nbsp; The runners of the houses of ill-fame are always on
the watch for them, and from various causes many of these girls fall 
victims to them and join the lost sisterhood.&nbsp; They are generally the 
daughters of farmers, or working men, and when they come are fresh in 
constitution and blooming in their young beauty.&nbsp; God pity them!&nbsp;
These blessings soon vanish.&nbsp; They dare not escape from their slavery,
for they have no means of earning a living in the great city, and they know
they would not be received at home, were their story known.&nbsp; Their 
very mothers would turn from them with loathing.&nbsp; Without hope, they 
cling to their shame, and sink lower and lower, until death mercifully ends
their human sufferings.&nbsp; As long as they are prosperous, they 
represent in their letters home that they are engaged in a steady, honest 
business, and the parents&rsquo; fears are lulled.&nbsp; After awhile these
letters are rarer.&nbsp; Finally they cease altogether.&nbsp; Would a 
father find his child after this, he must seek her in the foulest hells of 
the city.</p>
<p>When other arts fail, the wretches who lie in wait for women here seek 
to ruin them by foul means.&nbsp; They are drugged, or are forced into 
ruin.&nbsp; A woman in New York cannot be too careful.&nbsp; There are many
scoundrels in the city who make it their business to annoy and insult 
respectable ladies in the hope of luring them to lives of shame.&nbsp; 
Young girls have been frequently enticed into low class brothels and forced
to submit to outrage.&nbsp; Very few of the perpetrators of these crimes 
are punished as they deserve.&nbsp; Even if the victim complains to the 
<!-- page 586--><a name="page586"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
586</span>police, it amounts to nothing.&nbsp; The same species of crime is
practised every year.</p>
<p>The police are frequently called upon by persons from other parts of the
country, for aid in seeking a lost daughter, or a sister, or some female 
relative.&nbsp; Sometimes these searches, which are always promptly made, 
are rewarded with success.&nbsp; Some unfortunates are, in this way, saved 
before they have fallen so low as to make efforts in their behalf 
vain.&nbsp; Others, overwhelmed with despair, will refuse to leave their 
shame.&nbsp; They cannot bear the pity or silent scorn of their former 
relatives and friends, and prefer to cling to their present homes.&nbsp; It
is very hard for a fallen woman to retrace her steps, even if her friends 
or relatives are willing to help her do so.</p>
<p>Last winter an old gray-haired man came to the city from his farm in New
England, accompanied by his son, a manly youth, in search of his lost 
daughter.&nbsp; His description enabled the police to recognize the girl as
one who had but recently appeared in the city, and they at once led the 
father and brother to the house of which she was an inmate.&nbsp; As they 
entered the parlor, the girl recognized her father, and with a cry of joy 
sprang into his arms.&nbsp; She readily consented to go back with him, and 
that night all three left the city for their distant home.</p>
<p>A gentleman once found his daughter in one of the first-class houses of 
the city, to which she had been tracked by the police.&nbsp; He sought her 
there, and she received him with every demonstration of joy and 
affection.&nbsp; He urged her to return home with him, promising that all 
should be forgiven, and forgotten, but she refused to do so, and was deaf 
to all his entreaties.&nbsp; He brought her mother to see her, and though 
the girl clung to her and wept bitterly in parting, she would not go 
home.&nbsp; She felt that it was too late.&nbsp; She was lost.</p>
<p>Many of these poor creatures treasure sacredly the memories of their 
childhood and home.&nbsp; They will speak of them with a calmness which 
shows how deep and real is their despair.&nbsp; They would flee from their 
horrible lives if they could, but they are so enslaved that they are not 
able to do so.&nbsp; Their sin crushes them to the earth, and they cannot 
rise above it.</p>
<p><!-- page 587--><a name="page587"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
587</span>Drunkenness is very common among women of this class.&nbsp; 
Generally the liquors used are of an inferior quality, and do their 
dreadful work on the health and beauty of their victim very quickly.&nbsp; 
The use of narcotics is also very common.&nbsp; All the drug stores in the 
vicinity of these houses sell large quantities of opium, chloroform, and 
morphia.&nbsp; Absinthe is a popular drink.&nbsp; This liquor is a slow but
deadly poison, and destroys the nervous system and brain, and produces 
insanity.&nbsp; Suicides are frequent, and many of the poor creatures fall 
victims to the brutality of the men who seek their society.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; HOUSES OF ASSIGNATION.</h3>
<p>There are over one hundred houses of assignation of all kinds in the 
city known to the police.&nbsp; This estimate includes the bed-houses, of 
which we shall speak further on.&nbsp; Besides these, there are places used
for assignations which the officials of the law do not and cannot include 
in their returns.&nbsp; These are the smaller hotels, and sometimes the 
larger ones.&nbsp; Sometimes women take rooms in some of the cheap hotels, 
and there receive the visits of men whose acquaintance they have made on 
the street or at some place of amusement.&nbsp; Very often the proprietor 
of the house is simply victimized by such people, and several respectable 
houses have been so far overrun by them that decent persons have avoided 
them altogether.&nbsp; One or two of the smaller hotels of the city bear a 
most unenviable reputation of this kind.&nbsp; Even the first-class hotels 
cannot keep themselves entirely free from the presence of courtezans of the
better class.&nbsp; Rich men keep their mistresses at them in elegant 
style, and the guests, and sometimes the proprietors, are in utter 
ignorance of the woman&rsquo;s true character.&nbsp; Again, women will live
at the fashionable hotels, in the strictest propriety, and live by the 
proceeds of their meetings with men at houses of assignation.</p>
<p>The best houses are located in respectable, and a few in <!-- page 
588--><a name="page588"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 588</span>fashionable 
neighborhoods.&nbsp; In various ways they soon acquire a notoriety amongst 
persons having use for them.&nbsp; In the majority of them, the 
proprietress resides alone.&nbsp; Her visitors are persons of all classes 
in society.&nbsp; Married women meet their lovers here, and young girls 
pass in these polluted chambers the hours their parents suppose them to be 
devoting to healthful and innocent amusements.&nbsp; There are many 
nominally virtuous women in the city who visit these places one or more 
times each week.&nbsp; They come in the day, if necessary, but generally at
night.&nbsp; A visit to the theatre, the opera, or a concert is too often 
followed by a visit to one of these places.&nbsp; It is said by those who 
claim to know, that sometimes women of good social position even possess 
pass keys to such houses.&nbsp; The hot-house fashionable society, to which
we have referred elsewhere, sends many visitors here.&nbsp; Some married 
women visit these places because they love other men better than their 
lawful husbands.&nbsp; Others sin from mercenary motives.&nbsp; Their 
limited means do not allow them to gratify their taste for dress and 
display, and they acquire the desired ability in this infamous manner.</p>
<p>The majority of the houses are well known, and are scarcely conducted 
with secrecy, which is the chief requisite.&nbsp; The better class houses 
are handsomely furnished, and everything is conducted in the most secret 
manner.&nbsp; The police have often discovered assignation houses in 
residences which they believed to be simply the homes of private 
families.&nbsp; All these houses bring high rents.&nbsp; Men of 
&ldquo;respectable&rdquo; position have been known to furnish houses for 
this use, and have either engaged women to manage them, or have let them at
enormous rents, supporting their own families in style on the proceeds of 
these dens of infamy.</p>
<p>The prices paid by visitors for the use of the rooms are large, and the 
receipts of the keeper make her fully able to pay the large rent demanded 
of her.</p>
<p>The city papers contain numerous advertisements, which reveal to the 
initiated the locality of these houses.&nbsp; They are represented as 
&ldquo;Rooms to let to quiet persons,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rooms in a strictly 
private family, where boarders are not annoyed with <!-- page 589--><a 
name="page589"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 589</span>impertinent 
questions,&rdquo; or &ldquo;A handsome room to let, with board for the lady
only,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Handsome apartments to gentlemen, by a widow lady 
living alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; These advertisements are at once recognized by 
those in search of them.&nbsp; Families from the country frequently stumble
across these places by accident.&nbsp; If the female members are young and 
handsome, they are received, and the mistake is not found out, perhaps, 
until it is too late.</p>
<p>Public houses of prostitution are bad enough, but houses of assignation 
are worse.&nbsp; The former are frequented only by the notoriously 
impure.&nbsp; The latter draw to them women who, while sinning, retain 
their positions in society.&nbsp; The more secret the place, the more 
dangerous it is.&nbsp; The secrecy is but an encouragement to sin.&nbsp; 
Were the chance of detection greater, women, at least, would hesitate 
longer before visiting them, but they know that they can frequent them 
habitually, without fear of discovery.&nbsp; Their outward appearance of 
respectability is a great assistance to the scoundrels who seek to entrap 
an innocent female within their walls.&nbsp; They form the worst feature of
the Social Evil, and something should be done to suppress them.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; THE STREET WALKERS.</h3>
<p>Strangers visiting the city are struck with the number of women who are 
to be found on Broadway and the streets running parallel with it, without 
male escorts, after dark.&nbsp; They pass up and down the great 
thoroughfares at a rapid pace peculiar to them, glancing sharply at all the
men they meet, and sometimes speaking to them in a low, quick 
undertone.&nbsp; One accustomed to the city can recognize them at a glance,
and no man of common sense could fail to distinguish them from the 
respectable women who are forced to be out on the streets alone.&nbsp; They
are known as Street Walkers, and constitute one of the lowest orders of 
prostitutes to be found in New York.&nbsp; They seem to be on the increase 
during the present winter; and in Broadway especially are more numerous and
bolder than they <!-- page 590--><a name="page590"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 590</span>have been for several years.&nbsp; The best 
looking and the best dressed are seen on Broadway, and in parts of the 
Fifth and Fourth avenues.&nbsp; The others correspond to the localities 
they frequent.&nbsp; They are chiefly young girls, seventeen being the 
average age, but you will see children of twelve and thirteen among 
them.&nbsp; Very few promenade Broadway below Canal street.&nbsp; The 
neighborhoods of the hotels and places of amusement are the most 
frequented.&nbsp; Some of the girls are quite pretty and affect a modest 
deportment, but the majority are hideous and brazen.&nbsp; New faces are 
constantly appearing on Broadway, to take the places of those who have gone
down into the depths.</p>
<p>Many of these girls have some regular employment, at which they work 
during the day.&nbsp; Their regular earnings are small, and they take this 
means of increasing them.&nbsp; The majority, however, depend upon their 
infamous trade for their support.&nbsp; There have been rare cases in which
girls have been driven upon the streets by their parents, who either wish 
to rid themselves of the support of the girl, or profit by her 
earnings.&nbsp; We have known cases where the girls have voluntarily 
supported their parents by the wages of their shame.&nbsp; There were once 
two sisters, well known on Broadway, who devoted their earnings to paying 
off a heavy debt of their father, which he was unable to meet.&nbsp; Such 
instances, however, are very rare.</p>
<p>As a rule the girls seek the streets from mercenary motives.&nbsp; They 
begin their wretched lives in the society of the most depraved, and are not
long in becoming criminals themselves.&nbsp; They are nearly all thieves, 
and a very large proportion of them are but the decoys of the most 
desperate male garroters and thieves.&nbsp; The majority of them are the 
confederates of panel thieves.&nbsp; They are coarse, ugly, and disgusting,
and medical men who are called on to treat them professionally, state that 
as a class they are terribly diseased.&nbsp; A healthy Street Walker is 
almost a myth.</p>
<p>Were these women dependent for their custom upon the city people, who 
know them for what they are, they would starve.&nbsp; They know this, and 
they exert their arts principally upon <!-- page 591--><a 
name="page591"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 591</span>strangers.&nbsp; 
Strangers are more easily deceived, and, as a rule, have money to 
lose.&nbsp; Hundreds of strangers, coming to the city, follow them to their
rooms, only to find themselves in the power of thieves, who compel them on 
pain of instant death to surrender all their valuables.&nbsp; The room 
taken by the decoy is vacated immediately after the robbery, the girl and 
her confederate disappear, and it is impossible to find them.</p>
<p>I know that this whole subject is unsavory, and I have not introduced it
from choice.&nbsp; The Social Evil is a terrible fact here, and it is 
impossible to ignore it, and I believe that some good may be done by 
speaking of it plainly and stripping it of any romantic features.&nbsp; It 
is simply a disgusting and appalling feature of city life, and as such it 
is presented here.&nbsp; I know that these pages will find their way into 
the hands of those who contemplate visiting the city, and who will be 
assailed by the street girls.&nbsp; To them I would say that to accompany 
these women to their homes is simply to invite robbery and disease.&nbsp; 
New York has an abundance of attractions of the better kind, and those who 
desire amusement may find it in innocent enjoyment.&nbsp; Those who 
deliberately seek to indulge in sensuality and dissipation in a city to 
which they are strangers, deserve all the misfortunes which come to them in
consequence.</p>
<p>The police do not allow the girls to stop and converse with men on 
Broadway.&nbsp; If a girl succeeds in finding a companion, she beckons him 
into one of the side streets, where the police will not interfere with 
her.&nbsp; If he is willing to go with her, she conducts him to her room, 
which is in one of the numerous Bed Houses of the city.&nbsp; These bed 
houses are simply large or small dwellings containing many furnished rooms,
which are let to street walkers by the week, or which are hired to 
applicants of any class by the night.&nbsp; They are very profitable, and 
are frequently owned by men of good social position, who rent them out to 
others, or who retain the ownership, and employ a manager.&nbsp; The rent, 
whether weekly or nightly, is invariably paid in advance, so that the 
landlord loses nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p592.jpg">
<img alt="THE RESULT OF FOLLOWING A STREET WALKER." src="images/p592.jpg" 
/>
</a></p>
<p>The girl leads her companion to one of these houses, and if she has a 
room already engaged, proceeds directly to it; if not, <!-- page 592--><a 
name="page592"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 592</span>one is engaged from a
domestic on the spot, the price is paid, and the parties are shown up 
stairs.&nbsp; The place is kept dark and quiet, in order to avoid the 
attention of the police.&nbsp; The houses are more or less comfortable and 
handsome, according to the class by which they are patronized.&nbsp; They 
are sometimes preferred by guilty parties in high life, as the risk of 
being seen and recognized is less there than in more aristocratic 
houses.&nbsp; These houses have a constant run of visitors from about eight
o&rsquo;clock until long after midnight.</p>
<p>The Street Walkers not only infest the city itself, but literally 
overrun the various night lines of steamers plying between New York and the
neighboring towns.&nbsp; The Albany and <!-- page 593--><a 
name="page593"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 593</span>Boston lines are so 
thronged by these women that ladies are subjected to the greatest 
annoyance.</p>
<p>We have referred once or twice to panel thieving.&nbsp; This method of 
robbery is closely connected with street walking.&nbsp; The girl in this 
case acts in concert with a confederate, who is generally a man.&nbsp; She 
takes her victim to her room, and directs him to deposit his clothing on a 
chair, which is placed but a few inches from the wall at the end of the 
room.&nbsp; This wall is false, and generally of wood.&nbsp; It is built 
some three or four feet from the real wall of the room, thus forming a 
closet.&nbsp; As the whole room is papered and but dimly lighted, a visitor
cannot detect the fact that it is a sham.&nbsp; A panel, which slides 
noiselessly and rapidly, is arranged in the false wall, and the chair with 
the visitor&rsquo;s clothing upon it is placed just in front of it.&nbsp; 
While the visitor&rsquo;s attention is engaged in another quarter, the 
girl&rsquo;s confederate, who is concealed in the closet, slides back the 
panel, and rifles the pockets of the clothes on the chair.&nbsp; The panel 
is then noiselessly closed.&nbsp; When the visitor is about to depart, or 
sometimes not until long after his departure, he discovers his loss.&nbsp; 
He is sure the girl did not rob him, and he is completely bewildered in his
efforts to account for the robbery.&nbsp; Of course the police could tell 
him how his money was taken, and could recover it, too, but in nine cases 
out of ten the man is ashamed to seek their assistance, as he does not wish
his visit to such a place to be known.&nbsp; The thieves know this, and 
this knowledge gives them a feeling of security which emboldens them to 
commit still further depredations.&nbsp; The panel houses are generally 
conducted by men, who employ the women to work for them.&nbsp; The woman is
sometimes the wife of the proprietor of the house.&nbsp; The robberies 
nightly perpetrated foot up an immense aggregate.&nbsp; The visitors are 
mainly strangers, and many of these go into these dens with large sums of 
money on their persons.&nbsp; The police have been notified of losses 
occurring in this way, amounting in a single instance to thousands of 
dollars.&nbsp; The majority of the sums stolen are small, however, and the 
victims bear the loss in silence.&nbsp; The police authorities are 
thoroughly informed concerning the locality and operations of these <!-- 
page 594--><a name="page594"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
594</span>establishments, but they suffer them to go on without any effort 
to break them up.</p>
<h3>IV.&nbsp; THE CONCERT SALOONS.</h3>
<p>There are about seventy-five or eighty concert saloons in New York, 
employing abandoned women as waitresses.&nbsp; The flashiest of these are 
located on Broadway, there being nearly twenty of these infamous places on 
the great thoroughfare between Spring and Fourth streets.&nbsp; During the 
day they are closed, but one of the most prominent sets out before its 
doors a large frame containing twenty or thirty exquisite card photographs,
and bearing these words, &ldquo;Portraits of the young ladies employed in 
this saloon.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is needless to say that the pictures are taken
at random from the stock of some photograph dealer, and have no connection 
whatever with the hags employed in the saloon.&nbsp; The Bowery, Chatham 
street, and some of the streets leading from Broadway, contain the greater 
number of these concert saloons.&nbsp; The majority are located in the 
basements of the buildings, but one or two of the Broadway establishments 
use second story rooms.&nbsp; These places may be recognized by their 
numerous gaudy transparencies and lamps, and by the discordant strains of 
music which float up into the street from them.&nbsp; The Broadway saloons 
are owned by a few scoundrels, many of them being conducted by the same 
proprietor.&nbsp; A writer in the New York <i>World</i> was recently 
favored with the following truthful description of these places by one of 
the best known proprietors:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A concert saloon is a gin-mill on an improved 
plan&mdash;that&rsquo;s all, my friend.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t pay the girls 
any wages.&nbsp; They get a percentage on the drinks they sell.&nbsp; Some 
saloon-keepers pays their girls regular wages and a small percentage 
besides, but it don&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; The girls wont work unless they 
have to.&nbsp; Now, my girls gets a third of whatever they sell.&nbsp; The 
consequence is, they sell twice as much as they would if they was on 
wages.&nbsp; You never can get people to work faithfully for you unless 
they <!-- page 595--><a name="page595"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
595</span>can make money by it.&nbsp; The liquor is cheap, and I 
don&rsquo;t mind telling you its d---d nasty, then we charge double prices 
for it.&nbsp; Now, I charge twenty cents for drinks that a regular gin-mill
would sell for ten.&nbsp; Then there are a lot of drinks that the girls 
takes themselves, which we charges fifty cents for.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t 
cost us more than four or five, but after a girl has said what she&rsquo;ll
take, and a man has ordered it, he can&rsquo;t go back on the price.&nbsp; 
Then hardly any man stops at less than two or three drinks here, when he 
would take only one at a bar.&nbsp; The lights are the same as they would 
be anywheres else, and the music don&rsquo;t cost much.&nbsp; Then 
there&rsquo;s other ways to make in this business.&nbsp; But you 
don&rsquo;t want to know all about the speculations.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s 
keno, for instance.&nbsp; The keno business is attached to lots of 
saloons.&nbsp; You see the girls manages to get young fellows that come 
here&mdash;like those hounds yonder&mdash;pretty full, and then they says: 
&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try your luck in the next room, and go shares 
with me?&rsquo;&nbsp; So the fool he bites at once, and goes in for 
keno.&nbsp; Of course luck goes against him, for he&rsquo;s too drunk to 
play&mdash;O, the game&rsquo;s a square one&mdash;and he finally comes back
for another drink.&nbsp; The girls then takes care that he doesn&rsquo;t go
away till he&rsquo;s too drunk to remember where he lost his money.&nbsp; 
Even if he goes away sober, he seldom splits.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give the 
fellows that much credit.&nbsp; Bad as they are, they seldom 
splits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The concert saloons derive their names from the fact that a low order of
music is provided by the proprietor as a cover to the real character of the
place.&nbsp; It may be an old cracked piano, with a single, half-drunken 
performer, or a couple or more musicians who cannot by any possible means 
draw melody from their wheezy instruments.</p>
<p>Persons entering these places assume a considerable risk.&nbsp; They 
voluntarily place themselves in the midst of a number of abandoned 
wretches, who are ready for any deed of violence or crime.&nbsp; They care 
for nothing but money, and will rob or kill for it.&nbsp; Respectable 
people have no business in such places.&nbsp; They are very apt to have 
their pockets picked, and are in danger of violence.&nbsp; Many men, who 
leave their happy homes <!-- page 596--><a name="page596"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 596</span>in the morning, visit these places, for 
amusement or through curiosity, at night.&nbsp; They are drugged, robbed, 
murdered, and then the harbor police may find their lifeless forms floating
in the river at daybreak.</p>
<p>The women known outside of the city as &ldquo;pretty waiter 
girls,&rdquo; are simply a collection of poor wretches who have gone down 
almost to the end of their fatal career.&nbsp; They may retain faint 
vestiges of their former beauty, but that is all.&nbsp; They are beastly, 
foul-mouthed, brutal wretches.&nbsp; Very many of them are half dead with 
consumption and disease.&nbsp; They are in every respect disgusting.&nbsp; 
Yet young and old men, strangers and citizens, come here to talk with them 
and spend their money on them.&nbsp; Says the writer we have quoted, after 
describing a characteristic scene in one of these places:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only noticeable thing about this exhibition of beastliness is
the utter unconcern of the other occupants of the room.&nbsp; They are 
accustomed to it.&nbsp; One wonders, too, at the attraction this has for 
strangers.&nbsp; There is really nothing in the people, the place, or the 
onlookers worthy of a decent man&rsquo;s curiosity.&nbsp; The girls are, 
without exception, the nastiest, most besotted drabs that ever walked the 
streets.&nbsp; They haven&rsquo;t even the pride that clings to certain of 
their sisters who are in prison.&nbsp; The whole assemblage, with the 
exception of such stragglers as myself, who have a motive in studying it, 
is a mess of the meanest human rubbish that a great city exudes.&nbsp; In 
the company there is a large preponderance of the cub of seventeen and 
eighteen.&nbsp; Some of these boys are the sons of merchants and lawyers, 
and are &lsquo;seeing life.&rsquo;&nbsp; If they were told to go into their
kitchens at home and talk with the cook and the chambermaid, they would 
consider themselves insulted.&nbsp; Yet they come here and talk with other 
Irish girls every whit as ignorant and unattractive as the servants at 
home&mdash;only the latter are virtuous and these are infamous.&nbsp; Thus 
does one touch of vileness make the whole world kin.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 597--><a name="page597"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
597</span>V.&nbsp; THE DANCE HOUSES.</h3>
<p>The dance houses differ from the concert saloons in this respect, that 
they are one grade lower both as regards the inmates and the visitors, and 
that dancing as well as drinking is carried on in them.&nbsp; They are 
owned chiefly by men, though there are some which are the property of and 
are managed by women.&nbsp; They are located in the worst quarters of the 
city, generally in the streets near the East and North rivers, in order to 
be easy of access to the sailors.</p>
<p>The buildings are greatly out of repair, and have a rickety, dirty 
appearance.&nbsp; The main entrance leads to a long, narrow hall, the floor
of which is well sanded.&nbsp; The walls are ornamented with flashy prints,
and the ceiling with colored tissue paper cut in various fantastic 
shapes.&nbsp; There is a bar at the farther end of the room, which is well 
stocked with the meanest liquors, and chairs and benches are scattered 
about.</p>
<p>From five to a dozen women, so bloated and horrible to look upon, that a
decent man shudders with disgust as he beholds them, are lounging about the
room.&nbsp; They have reached the last step in the downward career of 
fallen women, and will never leave this place until they are carried from 
it to their graves, which are not far distant.&nbsp; They are miserably 
clad, and are nearly always half crazy with liquor.&nbsp; They are cursed 
and kicked about by the brutal owner of the place, and suffer still greater
violence, at times, in the drunken brawls for which these houses are 
famous.&nbsp; Their sleeping rooms are above.&nbsp; They are sought by 
sailors and by the lowest and most degraded of the city population.&nbsp; 
They are the slaves of their masters.&nbsp; They have no money of their 
own.&nbsp; He claims a part of their infamous earnings, and demands the 
rest for board and clothes.&nbsp; Few have the courage to fly from these 
hells, and if they make the attempt, they are forced back by the 
proprietor, who is frequently aided in this unholy act by the law of the 
land.&nbsp; They cannot go into the streets naked, and he claims the 
clothes on <!-- page 598--><a name="page598"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
598</span>their backs as his property.&nbsp; If they leave the premises 
with these clothes on, he charges them with theft.</p>
<p>Let no one suppose that these women entered upon this grade of their 
wretched life voluntarily.&nbsp; Many were drugged and forced into it, but 
the majority are lost women who have come regularly down the ladder to this
depth.&nbsp; You can find in these hells women who, but a few years ago, 
were ornaments of society.&nbsp; No woman who enters upon a life of shame 
can hope to avoid coming to these places in the end.&nbsp; As sure as she 
takes the first step in sin, she will take this last one also, struggle 
against it as she may.&nbsp; This is the last depth.&nbsp; It has but one 
bright ray in all its darkness&mdash;it does not last over a few months, 
for death soon ends it.&nbsp; But, O, the horrors of such a death!&nbsp; No
human being who has not looked on such a death-bed can imagine the horrible
form in which the Great Destroyer comes.&nbsp; There is no hope.&nbsp; The 
poor wretch passes from untold misery in this life to the doom which awaits
those who die in their sins.</p>
<p>The keepers of these wretched places use every art to entice young and 
innocent women into their dens, where they are ruined by force.&nbsp; The 
police frequently rescue women from them who have been enticed into them or
carried there by force.&nbsp; Emigrant girls, who have strolled from the 
depot at Castle Garden into the lower part of the city, are decoyed into 
these places by being promised employment.&nbsp; Men and women are sent 
into the country districts to ensnare young girls to these city 
hells.&nbsp; Advertisements for employment are answered by these wretches, 
and every art is exhausted in the effort to draw pure women within the 
walls of the dance house.&nbsp; Let such a woman once cross the threshold, 
and she will be drugged or forced to submit to her ruin.&nbsp; This 
accomplished, she will not be allowed to leave the place until she has lost
all hope of giving up the life into which she has been driven.</p>
<p>The Missionaries&rsquo; are constant visitors to these dens.&nbsp; They 
go with hope that they may succeed in rescuing some poor creature from her 
terrible life.&nbsp; As a rule, they meet with the vilest abuse, and are 
driven away with curses, but sometimes <!-- page 600--><a 
name="page600"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 600</span>they are 
successful.&nbsp; During the present winter they have succeeded in 
effecting a change for the better in one of the most notorious women in 
Water street.</p>

<h3>VI.&nbsp; HARRY HILL&rsquo;S.</h3>
<p>Harry Hill is a well-known man among the disreputable classes of New 
York.&nbsp; He is the proprietor of the largest and best known dance house 
in the city.&nbsp; His establishment is in Houston street, a few doors west
of Mulberry street, and almost under the shadow of the Police 
Headquarters.&nbsp; It is in full sight from Broadway, and at night a huge 
red and blue lantern marks the entrance door.&nbsp; Near the main entrance 
there is a private door for women.&nbsp; They are admitted free, as they 
constitute the chief attraction to the men who visit the place.&nbsp; 
Entering through the main door, the visitor finds himself in a low 
bar-room, very much like the other establishments of the kind in the 
neighborhood.&nbsp; Passing between the counters he reaches a door in the 
rear of them which opens into the dance hall, which is above the level of 
the bar-room.&nbsp; Visitors to this hall are charged an entrance fee of 
twenty-five cents, and are expected to call for refreshments as soon as 
they enter.</p>
<p>Harry Hill is generally present during the evening, moving about among 
his guests.&nbsp; He is a short, thick-set man, with a self-possessed, 
resolute air, and a face indicative of his calling, and is about fifty-four
years old.&nbsp; He is sharp and decided in his manner, and exerts himself 
to maintain order among his guests.&nbsp; He is enough of a politician to 
be very sure that the authorities will not be severe with him in case of 
trouble, but he has a horror of having his place entered by the police in 
their official capacity.&nbsp; He enforces his orders with his fists if 
necessary, and hustles refractory guests from his premises without 
hesitating.&nbsp; The &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; generally submit to his commands,
as they know he is a formidable man when aroused.&nbsp; He keeps his eye on
everything, and though he has a business manager, <!-- page 601--><a 
name="page601"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 601</span>conducts the whole 
establishment himself.&nbsp; He has been in his wretched business fifteen 
years, and is said to be wealthy.&nbsp; His profits have been estimated as 
high as fifty thousand dollars per annum.</p>
<p>Harry Hill boasts that he keeps a &ldquo;respectable house,&rdquo; but 
his establishment is nothing more than one of the many gates to hell with 
which the city abounds.&nbsp; There are no girls attached to the 
establishment.&nbsp; All the guests of both sexes are merely outsiders who 
come here to spend the evening.&nbsp; The rules of the house are printed in
rhyme, and are hung in the most conspicuous parts of the hall.&nbsp; They 
are rigid, and prohibit any indecent or boisterous conduct or profane 
swearing.&nbsp; The most disreputable characters are seen in the audience, 
but no thieving or violence ever occurs within the hall.&nbsp; Whatever 
happens after persons leave the place, the proprietor allows no violation 
of the law within his doors.</p>
<p>The hall itself consists simply of a series of rooms which have been 
&ldquo;knocked into one&rdquo; by the removal of the partition walls.&nbsp;
As all these rooms were not of the same height, the ceiling presents a 
curious patchwork appearance.&nbsp; A long counter occupies one end of the 
hall, at which refreshments and liquors are served.&nbsp; There is a stage 
at the other side, on which low farces are performed, and a tall Punch and 
Judy box occupies a conspicuous position.&nbsp; Benches and chairs are 
scattered about, and a raised platform is provided for the 
&ldquo;orchestra,&rdquo; which consists of a piano, violin, and a bass 
viol.&nbsp; The centre of the room is a clear space, and is used for 
dancing.&nbsp; If you do not dance you must leave, unless you atone for 
your deficiency by a liberal expenditure of money.&nbsp; The amusements are
coarse and low.&nbsp; The songs are broad, and are full of blasphemous 
outbursts, which are received with shouts of delight.</p>

<img alt="HARRY HILL&rsquo;S DANCE HOUSE." src="images/p602.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>You will see all sorts of people at Harry Hill&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The women 
are, of course, women of the town; but they are either just entering upon 
their career, or still in its most prosperous phase.&nbsp; They are all 
handsomely dressed, and some of them are very pretty.&nbsp; Some of them 
have come from the better classes of society, and have an elegance and 
refinement of manner and <!-- page 603--><a name="page603"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 603</span>conversation which win them many admirers in 
the crowd.&nbsp; They drink deep and constantly during the evening.&nbsp; 
Indeed, one is surprised to see how much liquor they imbibe.&nbsp; The 
majority come here early in the evening alone, but few go away without 
company for the night.&nbsp; You do not see the same face here very 
long.&nbsp; The women cannot escape the inevitable doom of the lost 
sisterhood.&nbsp; They go down the ladder; and Harry Hill keeps his place 
clear of them after the first flush of their beauty and success is 
past.&nbsp; You will then find them in the Five Points and Water street 
hells.</p>
<p>As for the men, they represent all kinds of people and 
professions.&nbsp; You may see here men high in public life, side by side 
with the Five Points ruffian.&nbsp; Judges, lawyers, policemen off duty and
in plain clothes, officers of the army and navy, merchants, bankers, 
editors, soldiers, sailors, clerks, and even boys, mingle here in friendly 
confusion.&nbsp; As the profits of the establishment are derived from the 
bar, drinking is, of course, encouraged, and the majority of the men are 
more or less drunk all the time.&nbsp; They spend their money freely in 
such a condition.&nbsp; Harry Hill watches the course of affairs closely 
during the evening.&nbsp; If he knows a guest and likes him, he will take 
care that he is not exposed to danger, after he is too far gone in liquor 
to protect himself.&nbsp; He will either send him home, or send for his 
friends.&nbsp; If the man is a stranger, he does not interfere&mdash;only, 
no crime must be committed in his house.&nbsp; Thieves, pickpockets, 
burglars, roughs, and pugilists are plentifully scattered through the 
audience.&nbsp; These men are constantly on the watch for victims.&nbsp; It
is easy for them to drug the liquor of a man they are endeavoring to 
secure, without the knowledge of the proprietor of the house; or, if they 
do not tamper with his liquor, they can persuade him to drink to 
excess.&nbsp; In either case, they lead him from the hall, under pretence 
of taking him home.&nbsp; He never sees home until they have stripped him 
of all his valuables.&nbsp; Sometimes he finds his long home, in less than 
an hour after leaving the hall; and the harbor police find his body 
floating on the tide at sunrise.&nbsp; Women frequently decoy men to places
where they are robbed.&nbsp; No <!-- page 604--><a name="page604"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 604</span>crime is committed in the dance hall, but 
plans are laid there, victims are marked, and tracked to loss or death, 
and, frequently, an idle, thoughtless visit there has been the beginning of
a life of ruin.&nbsp; The company to be met with is that which ought to be 
shunned.&nbsp; Visits from curiosity are dangerous.&nbsp; Stay away.&nbsp; 
To be found on the Devil&rsquo;s ground is voluntarily to surrender 
yourself a willing captive to him.&nbsp; Stay away.&nbsp; It is a place in 
which no virtuous woman is ever seen, and in which an honest man ought to 
be ashamed to show his face.</p>
<h3>VII.&nbsp; MASKED BALLS.</h3>
<p>The masked balls, which are held in the city every winter, are largely 
attended by impure women and their male friends.&nbsp; Even those which 
assume to be the most select are invaded by these people in spite of the 
precautions of the managers.&nbsp; Some of them are notoriously indecent, 
and it may be safely asserted that all are favorable to the growth of 
immorality.&nbsp; On the 22d of December, 1869, one of the most infamous 
affairs of this kind was held in the French Theatre, on Fourteenth 
street.&nbsp; I give the account of it published in the <i>World</i> of 
December 24th, of that year:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>&lsquo;Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bals 
d&rsquo;Artistes</i>,&rsquo; an organization which has no other excuse for 
existing than the profits of an annual dance, and which last year combined 
debauchery with dancing in a manner entirely new to this city, on Wednesday
night had possession of the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, in
which was to be given what was extensively advertised as the 
&lsquo;First<i> Bal d&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The only 
conspicuous name in this society (which is composed of Frenchmen) is that 
attached to the circular published below, but it is reasonable to suppose 
that the men who got up the ball were animated by a purely French desire to
make a little money and have a good deal of Parisian carousing, which 
should end, as those things do only in Paris, in high and comparatively 
harmless exhilaration.&nbsp; But they mistake the locality.&nbsp; This is 
<!-- page 605--><a name="page605"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
605</span>not Paris.&nbsp; The peculiar success of the ball given under 
their auspices last year was not forgotten by the class of roughs 
indigenous to New York.&nbsp; Under the name of <i>Bal 
d&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra</i>, licence, it was found, could be had for actions 
that would be no where else tolerated in a civilized community.&nbsp; It 
was found, moreover, that this description of ball would bring together, 
with its promise of licence, that class of reckless women who find 
opportunities to exhibit themselves in their full harlotry to the world, 
too much restricted and narrowed by enactment and public opinion not to 
take advantage of this one.&nbsp; The scenes which took place about the 
entrance of the French Theatre, when the <i>&lsquo;artistes&rsquo;</i> 
commenced to arrive, were sufficiently indicative of the character of the 
entertainment.&nbsp; At 11 o&rsquo;clock there were about a thousand men 
and boys there congregated, forming an impenetrable jam, through which the 
police kept open a narrow avenue for the masqueraders to pass from the 
coaches to the door.&nbsp; This crowd was manifestly made up of the two 
<i>sui generis</i> types of character which in this city have received the 
appellation of &lsquo;loafers&rsquo; and &lsquo;counter 
jumpers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Wide apart as they ordinarily may be, on such an 
occasion as this they are animated by common desires and common 
misfortunes.&nbsp; The inability to buy a ticket of admission, and the 
overpowering desire to see women disporting themselves in semi-nude attire 
and unprotected by any of the doubts which attach to their characters in 
ordinary street life, brought these moon-calves together, on a wet and 
chilly night, to stand for hours in the street to catch a passing glimpse 
of a stockinged leg or a bare arm, and to shout their ribald criticisms in 
the full immunity of fellowship.&nbsp; It was enough for them that the 
women came unattended.&nbsp; Every mask that stepped from her coach was 
beset by hoots and yells and the vile wit of shallow-brained ruffians, or 
the criticism of the staring counter-jumpers.&nbsp; There was also the 
chance open to the rougher members of this assemblage of ultimately getting
into the ball without paying.&nbsp; They had no well-defined plan, but they
felt instinctively that when their own passions had been sufficiently 
aroused, and when the later scenes inside had grown tumultuous, they could 
<!-- page 606--><a name="page606"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
606</span>knock the door-keeper&rsquo;s hat over his face, and go brawling 
in like wolves.&nbsp; There were knots of half-grown men on the corners of 
the street and about the adjacent pot-houses who were driving a good 
traffic in tickets, and other knots of creatures, neither men nor boys, but
that New York intermedium, who has lost the honesty of the boy without 
gaining the manliness of the man, were speculating upon the probabilities 
of a fight, and expressing very decided opinions as to the possibility of 
licking the Frenchmen who would endeavor to keep them out or keep them 
orderly after they got in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The attendants upon the ball, on entering the vestibule, were 
handed the following circular, printed neatly in blue ink:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The purpose of the President and Committee of the 
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bals d&rsquo;Artistes is to preserve the most 
stringent order, and to prevent any infraction of the laws of 
decency.&nbsp; Any attempt at disturbance or lewdness will be repressed 
with the most extreme severity, and sufficient force is provided to warrant
quietness and obedience to laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lsquo;The President,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">L. 
Mercier</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That such was the purpose of the committee we have no reason to 
doubt.&nbsp; But it was no wiser than the purpose of the man who invited a 
smoking party to his powder magazine, and told them his object was to 
prevent explosion.&nbsp; The dancing commenced at 11 o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; 
At that time the floor, extending from the edge of the dress-circle to the 
extreme limit of the stage, presented a curious spectacle.&nbsp; Probably 
there were a hundred masked women present, among five hundred masked and 
unmasked men.&nbsp; These women were dressed in fancy costumes, nearly all 
selected with a view to expose as much of the person as possible.&nbsp; By 
far the greater number wore trunk hose and fleshings; but many were attired
in the short skirts of the ballet, with some attempt at bayadere and 
daughter of the regiment in the bodices and trimmings.&nbsp; Here and there
a woman wore trailing skirts of rich material, and flashed her diamonds in 
the gaslight as she swung the train about.&nbsp; There was no attempt on 
the part of the men to assume imposing or elegant disguises.&nbsp; The 
cheapest dominoes, and generally nothing more than a mask, afforded them 
all they wanted&mdash;the <!-- page 607--><a name="page607"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 607</span>opportunity to carry on a bravado and 
promiscuous flirtation with these women.&nbsp; That part of the family 
circle tier which faces the stage was given up to the musicians.&nbsp; The 
rest of the gallery was crowded with spectators.&nbsp; The boxes below were
all taken up, the occupants being mainly maskers overlooking the 
dance.&nbsp; But the proscenium boxes, and notably the two lower ones on 
either side, were filled with a crew of coarse-featured, semi-officious 
looking roughs, who might be politicians, or gamblers, or deputy-sheriffs, 
or cut-throats, or all, but who, at all events, had no intention of 
dancing, and had hired these boxes with the one view of having a good time 
at the expense of the women, the managers, and, if necessary, the public 
peace itself.&nbsp; They were crowded in; some of them stood up and smoked 
cigars; all of them kept their hats on; one or two were burly beasts, who 
glared upon the half-exposed women on the floor with a stolid interest that
could only be heightened and intensified by some outrageous departure from 
the seemliness of simple enjoyment.&nbsp; They have their fellows on the 
floor, to whom they shout and telegraph.&nbsp; They have liquor in the 
boxes, and they use it with a show of conviviality to increase their 
recklessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At twelve o&rsquo;clock there is a jam; most of the crowd outside
has got in by some means; the floor is a mass of people.&nbsp; Suddenly 
there is a fight in the boxes.&nbsp; Exultant cries issue from the 
proscenium.&nbsp; At once turn up all the masked faces in the whirling 
mass.&nbsp; It is a Frenchman beset by two, aye three, Americans.&nbsp; 
Blows are given and taken; then they all go down out of sight&mdash;only to
appear again; the three are on him; they are screeching with that fierce 
animal sound that comes through set teeth, and in men and bull-dogs is 
pitched upon the same note.&nbsp; The maskers rather like it; they applaud 
and cheer on&mdash;not the parties, but the fight&mdash;and when the police
get into the boxes and drag out the assaulted man, and leave the assailants
behind, the proscenium bellows a moment with ironical laughter, the music 
breaks out afresh, and the dancers resume their antics as though nothing 
had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough liquor has now been swallowed to float recklessness <!-- 
page 608--><a name="page608"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 608</span>up to 
the high-water mark.&nbsp; There is another fight going on in the 
vestibule.&nbsp; One of the women has been caught up by the crowd and 
tossed bodily into the proscenium box, where she is caught and dragged by 
half a dozen brutes in over the sill and furniture in such a manner as to 
disarrange as much as possible what small vestige of raiment there is on 
her.&nbsp; The feat awakens general enjoyment.&nbsp; Men and women below 
vent their coarse laughter at the sorry figure she cuts and at the exposure
of her person.&nbsp; Presently the trick is repeated on the other 
side.&nbsp; A young woman, rather pretty and dressed in long skirts, is 
thrown up, and falls back into the arms of the crowd, who turn her over, 
envelop her head in her own skirts, and again toss her up temporarily 
denuded.&nbsp; The more exactly this proceeding outrages decency, the 
better it is liked.&nbsp; One or two repetitions of it occurred which 
exceeded the limits of proper recital.&nbsp; The women were bundled into 
the boxes, and there they were fallen upon by the crew of half drunken 
ruffians, and mauled, and pulled, and exhibited in the worst possible 
aspects, amid the jeers and laughter of the other drunken wretches upon the
floor.&nbsp; One, a heavier woman than the rest, is thrown out of the box 
and falls heavily upon the floor.&nbsp; She is picked up insensible by the 
police and carried out.&nbsp; There is not a whisper of shame in the 
crowd.&nbsp; It is now drunken with liquor and its own beastliness.&nbsp; 
It whirls in mad eddies round and round.&nbsp; The panting women in the 
delirium of excitement; their eyes, flashing with the sudden abnormal light
of physical elation, bound and leap like tigresses; they have lost the last
sense of prudence and safety.&nbsp; Some of them are unmasked, and reveal 
the faces of brazen and notorious she-devils, who elsewhere are cut off by 
edict from this contact with the public; a few of them are young, and would
be pretty but for the lascivious glare now lighting their faces and the 
smears of paint which overlay their skins; all of them are poisonous, 
pitiable creatures, suffering now with the only kind of delirium which 
their lives afford, rancorous, obscene, filthy beauties, out of the gutter 
of civilization, gone mad with the licence of music and the contact of men,
and beset by crowds of libidinous and unscrupulous <!-- page 609--><a 
name="page609"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 609</span>ninnies who, anywhere
else, would be ashamed of their intimacy, or roughs to whom this kind of a 
ball affords the only opportunity to exercise the few animal faculties that
are left to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Mercier stands in the middle of the floor, and shouts to the 
musicians to go on.&nbsp; For it isn&rsquo;t safe for them to stop.&nbsp; 
Whenever they do, there is a fight.&nbsp; One stalwart beauty, in bare 
arms, has knocked down a young man in the entrance way, and left the marks 
of her high heels on his face.&nbsp; She would have kicked the life out of 
him while her bully held him down, if a still stronger policeman had not 
flung her like a mass of offal into a corner.&nbsp; There she is picked up,
and, backed by a half dozen of her associates, pushes and strikes 
promiscuously, and the dense crowd about her push also and strike, and sway
here and there, and yell, and hiss, and curse, until the entire police 
force in the place drag out a score of them, and then the rest go on with 
the dancing, between which and the fighting there is so little 
difference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of the boxes sits --- ---, with a masked woman.&nbsp; But 
it is getting too warm for him.&nbsp; The few French women who came as 
spectators, and occupied the seats in the family circle, went away long 
ago.&nbsp; They were probably respectable.&nbsp; On the floor one sees at 
intervals well known men, who either were deceived by the announcement of a
<i>Bal d&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra</i>, or were too smart to be deceived by 
anything of this sort.&nbsp; A few newspaper reporters, looking on with 
stoical eye; here a prize-fighter, and there a knot of gamblers; here an 
adolescent alderman, dancing with a notorious inmate of the police courts; 
there a deputy sheriff, too drunk to be anything but sick and 
sensual.&nbsp; Now the can-can commences.&nbsp; But it comes without any 
zest, for all of its peculiarities have been indulged in long before.&nbsp;
It is no longer a dance at all, but a wild series of indecent exposures, a 
tumultuous orgie, in which one man is struck by an unknown assailant; and 
his cheek laid open with a sharp ring, and his white vest and tie splashed 
with blood, give a horrible color to the figure that is led out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an evident fear on the part of the ball officials that 
<!-- page 610--><a name="page610"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
610</span>matters will proceed too far.&nbsp; They endeavor to prevent the 
women from being pulled up into the boxes by laying hold of them and 
pulling them back, in which struggle the women are curiously wrenched and 
disordered, and the men in the boxes curse, and laugh, and shout, and the 
dancers, now accustomed to the spectacle, give it no heed whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is anything in the behaviour of the women that is at all
peculiar to the eye of an observer who is not familiar with the impulses 
and the manifestations of them in this class, it is the feverish 
abandonment into which drink and other excitements have driven them.&nbsp; 
It is not often that a common bawd, without brains or beauty enough to 
attract a passing glance, thus has the opportunity to elicit volleys of 
applause from crowds of men; and, without stopping to question the value of
it, she makes herself doubly drunken with it.&nbsp; If to kick up her 
skirts is to attract attention&mdash;hoop la!&nbsp; If indecency is then 
the distinguishing feature of the evening, she is the woman for your 
money.&nbsp; So she jumps rather than dances.&nbsp; She has a whole set of 
lascivious motions, fashioned quickly, which outdo the worst imaginings of 
the dirty-minded men who applaud her.&nbsp; She springs upon the backs of 
the men, she swaggers, she kicks off hats.&nbsp; She is a small sensation 
in herself, and feels it, and goes about with a defiant and pitiless 
recklessness, reigning for the few brief hours over the besotted men who 
feel a fiend&rsquo;s satisfaction in the unnatural exhibition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To particularize to any greater extent would be to make public 
the habits and manners of the vilest prostitutes in their proper haunts, 
where, out of the glare of publicity, they may, and probably do, perfect 
themselves in the indecencies most likely to catch the eyes of men little 
better than themselves, but which thus brought together under the gaslight 
of the public chandelier is, to the healthy man, like the application of 
the microscope to some common article of food then found to be a feculent 
and writhing mass of living nastiness.&nbsp; That respectable foreigners 
were induced to attend this ball by the representations made by the 
managers is certain.&nbsp; That they were outraged by what took place 
there, is beyond all doubt.&nbsp; To suppose a <!-- page 611--><a 
name="page611"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 611</span>man deceived as to 
the character of the entertainment, and to go there and mingle with masked 
ladies, who for a while ape the deportment of their betters, is to suppose 
a sensation for him at once startling; for when the richly dressed ladies 
doff their masks, he finds himself surrounded by a ghastly assemblage of 
all the most virulent social corruption in our civilization; dowagers turn 
out to be the fluffy and painted keepers of brothels; the misses sink into 
grinning hussies, who are branded on the cheeks and forehead with the 
ineradicable mark of shame; and the warm and coy pages, whom at the worst 
he might have supposed to be imprudent or improvident girls, stare at him 
with the deathly-cold implacability of the commonest 
street-walkers&mdash;those in fact who glory in their shame, and whose very
contact is vile to anything with a spark of healthy moral or physical life 
in it.&nbsp; If, indeed, they had lain off their sickly flesh with their 
masks, and gone grinning and rattling round the brilliant hall in their 
skeletons, the transformation could not have chilled your unsuspecting man 
with a keener horror.&nbsp; But it is safe to say the unsuspecting were few
indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At two o&rsquo;clock this curious spectacle was at its 
height.&nbsp; All about the Institute, and on the stairs, and in the 
cloak-rooms, and through the narrow, tortuous passages leading to the stage
dressing-rooms were vile tableaus of inflamed women and tipsy men, bandying
brutality and obscenity.&nbsp; The animal was now in full possession of its
faculties.&nbsp; But, just as the orgie is bursting into the last 
stage&mdash;a free fight&mdash;when the poor creatures in their hired 
costumes are ready to grovel in the last half-oblivious scenes, the 
musicians rattle off &lsquo;Home, Sweet Home,&rsquo; with a strange, 
hurried irony, and the managers, with the same haste, turn off the gas of 
the main chandelier, and the <i>Bal d&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra</i> is at an 
end.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>VIII.&nbsp; PERSONALS.</h3>
<p>The first column of one of the most prominent daily newspapers, which is
taken in many respectable families of the city, <!-- page 612--><a 
name="page612"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 612</span>and which claims to 
be at the head of American journalism, bears the above heading, and there 
is also a personal column in a prominent Sunday paper, which is also read 
by many respectable people.&nbsp; Very many persons are inclined to smile 
at these communications, and are far from supposing that these journals are
making themselves the mediums through which assignations and burglaries, 
and almost every disreputable enterprise are arranged and carried on.&nbsp;
Yet, such is the fact.&nbsp; Many of these advertisements are inserted by 
notorious rou&eacute;s, and others are from women of the town.&nbsp; Women 
wishing to meet their lovers, or men their mistresses, use these personal 
columns.</p>
<p>Respectable women have much to annoy them in the street conveyances, and
at the places of amusement.&nbsp; If a lady allows her face to wear a 
pleasant expression while glancing by the merest chance at a man, she is 
very apt to find some such personal as the following addressed to her in 
the next morning&rsquo;s issue of the paper referred to:</p>
<p>THIRD AVENUE CAR, DOWN TOWN YESTERDAY morning; young lady in black, who 
noticed gent opposite, who endeavored to draw her attention to Personal 
column of --- in his hand, will oblige admirer by sending address to B., 
Box 102, --- office.</p>
<p>If she is a vile woman, undoubtedly she will do so, and that 
establishment will deliver her letter, and do its part in helping on the 
assignation.</p>
<p>A gentleman will bow to a lady, and she, thinking it may be a friend, 
returns the bow.&nbsp; The next day appears the following:</p>
<p>TALL LADY DRESSED IN BLACK, WHO acknowledged gentleman&rsquo;s salute, 
Broadway and Tenth street, please address D., box 119, --- office, if she 
wishes to form his acquaintance.</p>
<p>Sometimes a man will whisper the word &ldquo;personal&rdquo; to the lady
whom he dares not insult further, and the next day the following 
appears:</p>
<p><!-- page 613--><a name="page613"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
613</span>TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 4 P.M.&mdash;&ldquo;CAN YOU answer a 
personal?&rdquo;&nbsp; Fifth avenue stage from Grand to Twenty-third 
street.&nbsp; Please address BEN. VAN DYKE, --- office, appointing 
interview.&nbsp; To prevent mistake, mention some particulars.</p>
<p>Others more modest:</p>
<p>WILL THE LADY THAT WAS LEFT WAITING by her companion on Monday evening, 
near the door of an up-town theatre, grant an interview to the gentleman 
that would have spoken if he had thought the place appropriate?&nbsp; 
Address ROMANO, --- office.</p>
<p>It is really dangerous to notice a patron of the paper mentioned, for he
immediately considers it ground for a personal, such as the following:</p>
<p>LADY IN GRAND STREET CAR, SATURDAY evening 7.30.&mdash;Had on plaid 
shawl, black silk dress; noticed gentleman in front; both got out at 
Bowery; will oblige by sending her address to C. L., box 199, --- 
office.</p>
<p>Young ladies with attendants are not more free from this public insult, 
as shown by the following:</p>
<p>WILL THE YOUNG LADY THAT GOT OUT OF a Fifth avenue stage, with a 
gentleman with a cap on at 10 yesterday, at Forty-sixth street, address E. 
ROBERTS, New York Post-office.</p>
<p>This public notice must be pleasing to the young lady and to &ldquo;the 
gentleman with the cap on.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a notice that the gentleman 
believes the lady to be willing to have an intrigue with him.&nbsp; If it 
goes as far as that, this newspaper will lend its columns to the 
assignation as follows:</p>
<p>LOUISE K.&mdash;DEAR, I HAVE RECEIVED YOUR letter, last Saturday, but 
not in time to meet you.&nbsp; Next Tuesday, Dec. 7, I will meet you at the
same time and place.&nbsp; East.&nbsp; Write to me again, and give your 
address.&nbsp; Your old acquaintance.</p>
<p>Or as follows:</p>
<p>L. HATTIE B.&mdash;FRIDAY, AT 2.30 P.M.</p>
<p><!-- page 614--><a name="page614"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
614</span>The personal column is also used to publicly advertise the 
residences of women of the town.&nbsp; The following are specimens:</p>
<p>MISS GERTIE DAVIS, FORMERLY OF LEXINGTON avenue, will be pleased to see 
her friends at 106 Clinton place.</p>
<p>ERASTUS&mdash;CALL ON JENNIE HOWARD at 123 West Twenty-seventh 
street.&nbsp; I have left Heath&rsquo;s.&nbsp; 132.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; ALBANY.</p>
<p>The <i>World</i> very justly remarks: &ldquo;The cards of courtesans and
the advertisements of houses of ill-fame might as well be put up in the 
panels of the street cars.&nbsp; If the public permits a newspaper to do it
for the consideration of a few dollars, why make the pretence that there is
anything wrong in the thing itself?&nbsp; If the advertisement is 
legitimate, then the business must be.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IX.&nbsp; THE MIDNIGHT MISSION.</h3>
<p>With the hope of checking the terrible evil of immorality which is doing
such harm in the city, several associations for the reformation of fallen 
women have been organized by benevolent citizens.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting of these is &ldquo;<i>The Midnight 
Mission</i>,&rdquo; which is located at No. 260 Greene street, in the very 
midst of the worst houses of prostitution in the city.&nbsp; It was 
organized about four years ago, and from its organization to the latter 
part of the year 1870, had sheltered about 600 women.&nbsp; In 1870, 202 
women and girls sought refuge in the Mission.&nbsp; Twenty-eight of these 
were sent to other institutions, forty-seven were placed in good 
situations, fifteen were restored to their friends, and forty-nine went 
back to their old ways.&nbsp; The building is capable of accommodating from
forty-five to fifty inmates.&nbsp; The members of the Society go out on the
streets every Friday night, and as they encounter the Street Walkers, 
accost them, detain them a few moments in conversation, and hand each of 
them a card bearing the following in print:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 615--><a name="page615"></a><span

<a href="images/p615.jpg">
<img alt="CARD" src="images/p615.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This invitation is sometimes tossed into the gutter or flung in the face
of the giver, but it is often accepted.&nbsp; More than this, it is a 
reminder to the girl that there is a place of refuge open to her, where she
may find friends willing and able to help her to escape from her life of 
sin.&nbsp; Even those who at first receive the card with insults to the 
giver, are won over by this thought, and they come to the Mission and ask 
to be received.&nbsp; Many of them, it is true, seek to make it a mere 
lodging-house, and deceive the officers by their false penitence, but many 
are saved from sin every year.&nbsp; The inmates come voluntarily, and 
leave when they please.&nbsp; There is no force used, but every moral 
influence that can be brought to bear upon them is exerted to induce them 
to remain.&nbsp; The preference is given to applicants who are very 
young.&nbsp; Those seeking the Mission are provided with refreshments, and 
are drawn into conversation.&nbsp; They are given such advice as they seem 
to need, and are induced to remain until the hour for prayers.&nbsp; Those 
who remain and show a genuine desire to reform are provided with work, and 
are given one-half of their earnings for their own use.</p>
<p>The Midnight Mission is a noble institution, and is doing a noble work, 
but it is sorely in need of funds.</p>

of the inmates are sent here by the courts of the city.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;House of the Good Shepherd&rdquo; is a Roman Catholic institution,

<h2><!-- page 618--><a name="page618"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
618</span>L.&nbsp; CHILD MURDER.</h2>
<p>On the 26th of August, 1871, at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, a 
truck drove up to the baggage-room of the Hudson River Railway depot, in 
Thirtieth street, and deposited on the sidewalk a large, common-looking 
travelling trunk.&nbsp; The driver, with the assistance of a boy hanging 
about the depot, carried the trunk into the baggage-room, and at this 
instant a woman of middle age, and poorly attired, entered the room, 
presented a ticket to Chicago, which she had just purchased, and asked to 
have the trunk checked to that place.&nbsp; The check was given her, and 
she took her departure.&nbsp; The baggage-master, half an hour later, in 
attempting to remove the trunk to the platform from which it was to be 
transferred to the baggage-car, discovered a very offensive odor arising 
from it.&nbsp; His suspicions were at once aroused, and he communicated 
them to the superintendent of the baggage-room, who caused the trunk to be 
removed to an old shed close by and opened.&nbsp; As the lid was raised a 
terrible sight was revealed.&nbsp; The trunk contained the dead body of a 
young woman, fully grown, and the limbs were compressed into its narrow 
space in the most appalling manner.&nbsp; The discovery was at once 
communicated to the police, and the body was soon after removed to the 
Morgue, where an inquest was held upon it.</p>
<p>The woman had been young and beautiful, and evidently a person of 
refinement, and the post mortem examination, which was made as speedily as 
possible, revealed the fact that she had been murdered in the effort to 
produce an abortion upon her.&nbsp; The case was at once placed in the 
hands of the detectives, and full details of the horrible affair were laid 
before the <!-- page 619--><a name="page619"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
619</span>public in the daily press.&nbsp; The efforts to discover the 
murderer were unusually successful.&nbsp; Little by little the truth came 
out.&nbsp; The cartman who had taken the trunk to the depot came forward, 
after reading the account of the affair in the newspapers, and conducted 
the police to the house where he had received it.&nbsp; This was none other
than the residence of Dr. Jacob Rosenzweig (No. 687 Second avenue), a 
notorious abortionist, who carried on his infamous business at No. 3 Amity 
Place, as Dr. Ascher.&nbsp; Suspecting his danger, Rosenzweig endeavored to
avoid the police, but they soon succeeded in securing him.&nbsp; His 
residence was taken possession of and searched, and papers were found which
completely established the fact that Rosenzweig and Ascher were one and the
same person.&nbsp; Rosenzweig was arrested on suspicion, and committed to 
the Tombs to await the result of the inquest.&nbsp; The body was 
subsequently identified by an acquaintance of the dead woman, as that of 
Miss Alice Bowlsby, of Patterson, New Jersey.&nbsp; A further search of 
Rosenzweig&rsquo;s premises resulted in the finding of a handkerchief 
marked with the dead woman&rsquo;s name, and other evidence was brought to 
light all making it too plain for doubt that Alice Bowlsby had died from 
the effects of an abortion produced upon her by Jacob Rosenzweig.&nbsp; The
wretch was tried for his offence, convicted, and sentenced to seven years 
of hard labor in the penitentiary.</p>
<p>This affair produced a profound impression not only upon the city, but 
upon the whole country, and drew the attention of the public so strongly to
the subject of abortion as a trade, that there is reason to believe that 
some steps will be taken to check the horrible traffic.</p>
<p>Bad as Rosenzweig was, he was but one of a set who are so numerous in 
the city that they constitute one of the many distinct classes of vile men 
and women who infest it.</p>
<p>The readers of certain of the city newspapers are familiar with the 
advertisements of these people, such as the following:</p>
<p>A LADIES&rsquo; PHYSICIAN, DR. ---, PROFESSOR of Midwifery, over 20 
years&rsquo; successful practice in this city, guarantees certain relief to
ladies, with or <!-- page 620--><a name="page620"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 620</span>without medicine, at one interview.&nbsp; 
Unfortunates please call.&nbsp; Relief certain.&nbsp; Residence, ---.&nbsp;
Elegant rooms for ladies requiring nursing.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT TO FEMALES.&nbsp; DR. AND MADAME --- (25 years&rsquo; 
practice,) guarantee certain relief to married ladies, with or without 
medicine, at one interview.&nbsp; Patients from a distance provided with 
nursing, board, etc.&nbsp; Electricity scientifically applied.</p>
<p>A CURE FOR LADIES IMMEDIATELY.&nbsp; MADAME ---&rsquo;s Female 
Antidote.&nbsp; The only reliable medicine that can be procured; certain to
have the desired effect in twenty-four hours, without any injurious 
results.</p>
<p>SURE CURE FOR LADIES IN TROUBLE.&nbsp; NO injurious medicines or 
instruments used.&nbsp; Consultation and advice free.</p>
<p>These are genuine advertisements, taken from a daily journal of great 
wealth and influence, which every morning finds its way into hundreds of 
families.&nbsp; The persons thus advertising are all of them members of the
most dangerous and disreputable portion of the community.&nbsp; They do 
not, indeed, attack citizens on the streets, but, what is worse and more 
cowardly, exert their skill for the purpose of destroying human life which 
is too helpless to resist, and which has no protector.&nbsp; These persons 
impudently assert that they do not violate the law in their infamous trade,
but it needs scarcely a physician&rsquo;s endorsement to make plain to 
sensible persons the fact that successful abortions are extremely 
rare.&nbsp; Indeed, the secrecy with which the infamous business is carried
on, shows that its practitioners are conscious of its criminality.&nbsp; 
The laws of all the States punish the procuring of an abortion with severe 
penalties.&nbsp; That of the State of New York declares, &ldquo;The wilful 
killing of an unborn quick child by any injury to the mother of the child, 
which would be murder if it resulted in the death of such mother, shall be 
deemed manslaughter in the first degree.&rdquo;&nbsp; The punishment for 
this crime is an imprisonment in the penitentiary for <i>not less</i> than 
seven years.&nbsp; The law further declares: &ldquo;Every person who shall 
administer to any woman pregnant with a quick child, or prescribe for any 
such woman, or advise and procure <!-- page 621--><a 
name="page621"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 621</span>for any such woman, 
any medicine, drugs, or substance whatever, or shall use or employ any 
instrument or other means, with intent thereby to destroy such child, 
unless the same shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such 
mother, shall, in case the death of such child or such mother be thereby 
produced, be deemed guilty of manslaughter in the second 
degree.&rdquo;&nbsp; The law prescribes as the punishment for this crime an
imprisonment of not less than four years&rsquo;, nor more than seven 
years&rsquo; duration.</p>
<p>This is seemingly very severe, but in reality it is not.&nbsp; Now that 
science has established the fact that to expel the f&oelig;tus at any 
period of pregnancy is to take life, or, in other words, to commit murder, 
the law should make the selling of drugs or medicines for such purpose a 
felony, and should punish with great severity any person publicly exposing 
or privately offering them for sale.&nbsp; Such a statute, so far from 
embarrassing any reputable member of the medical profession, would be 
hailed with joy by all; for science has progressed so far, that the cases 
in which it is necessary to produce an abortion for the sake of saving the 
mother&rsquo;s life are extremely rare.&nbsp; Further than this, it may be 
added that the drugs used by these Professors of Infanticide, are, as a 
rule, unused by the Medical Faculty.</p>
<p>Being well aware then of the penalties to which they are exposed, the 
Professors of Infanticide conduct their business with extreme 
caution.&nbsp; They have a great advantage under our present legal 
system.&nbsp; It has been found by experience that the only evidence by 
which they can generally be convicted of their crime, is that of the 
patient herself.&nbsp; Their knowledge of human nature teaches them that 
she is the last person in the world to ruin her own reputation by exposing 
them; and their knowledge of their devilish business teaches them that, if 
the case does terminate fatally, death will occur in all probability before
an <i>ante-mortem</i> statement implicating them can be made by their 
victim.&nbsp; A recent writer thus describes these wretches and their mode 
of operations:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the head of abortionists, it must be understood there are 
different classes.&nbsp; First, there is the one whose <!-- page 622--><a 
name="page622"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 622</span>advertisements, under
the head of &lsquo;Dr.,&rsquo; are conspicuous in almost every paper which 
will print them.&nbsp; Next comes the female abortionists, the richer 
classes of whom also advertise largely; and lastly, the midwives, who, when
it pays them to do so, will in some cases consent to earn money by the 
commission of this fearful crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First in order, then, the doctor, who styles himself the 
&lsquo;ladies&rsquo; friend,&rsquo; which appellation would be more 
truthful if the second letter were omitted from that word of 
endearment.&nbsp; He is, as a rule, either a man who has studied for a 
diploma and failed to pass his examination, or one who, though he is really
an M.D., because it pays better, devotes his time to this particular branch
of his profession, and advertises largely to that effect; while, in nine 
cases out of ten, if he attended to a legitimate branch of his vocation, he
would prove worthless and inefficient.&nbsp; There are many abortionists in
New York to-day who live in first-class style, attend to nothing but 
&lsquo;first-class&rsquo; cases, receive nothing but first-class fees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men, some of them at least, are received into fashionable 
society, not because of their gentlemanly or engaging manners, nor even yet
on account of their money, but from the fact that they exercise a certain 
amount of influence and are possessed of a vast deal of audacity.&nbsp; 
They are cognizant of many a family secret that comes under the 
jurisdiction of their peculiar vocation; and this fact enables them 
successfully, if they like, to dare these parties to treat them any other 
than respectfully.&nbsp; There is a skeleton in every house, a secret in 
every family; and too often the doctor, midwife, and accoucheur have to be 
treated publicly, socially, and pecuniarily in accordance with this 
fact.&nbsp; It is such men as these who, by their nefarious practices, have
been enabled to accumulate a large amount of money, that are the 
proprietors of private hospitals or lying-in asylums, where the better 
class of women who have fallen from the path of virtue may, under a 
pretence of a prolonged visit to some distant friends, become inmates, and,
after all traces of their guilt have been successfully hidden, can 
unblushingly return to their friends, and be regarded in their social 
circles as models of chastity and perfections of virtue.</p>
<p><!-- page 623--><a name="page623"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
623</span>&ldquo;Next come the female abortionists, who in some cases 
transact a larger and more profitable business than the doctors.&nbsp; 
There are several reasons for this, the principal of which is, that a 
female would, under the peculiar circumstances in which she is placed, 
reveal her condition to one of her own sex rather than to a man.&nbsp; The 
number of female abortionists in New York City is a disgrace and a ridicule
upon the laws for the prevention of such inhuman proceedings.&nbsp; True, 
the majority of them are of the poorer class, but there are many who are 
literally rolling in wealth, the result of their illegal and unnatural 
pursuits.&nbsp; The names of many could be mentioned.&nbsp; One, however, 
will be sufficient, and, although she has been the most successful of her 
contemporaries, yet her card is a good criterion for the rest of her 
class.&nbsp; Her name, Madame ---, is well known, and needs no 
comment.&nbsp; Most of the better and most successful of her kind are in 
the habit of receiving no less than one hundred or one hundred and fifty 
dollars for each case, and often as much as five hundred or one thousand 
dollars.&nbsp; The less successful of the female abortionists, whose 
practice or business is limited, to some extent, through lack of funds to 
advertise the same, are content with considerably less sums for their 
services.&nbsp; Cases have been known where as low as five dollars have 
been received, and very rarely do they get a chance to make more than fifty
or sixty dollars, which is considered a first-rate fee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The female abortionists in New York are mostly of foreign birth 
or extraction, and have generally risen to their present position from 
being first-class nurses&mdash;in Germany, especially, there being medicine
schools or colleges in which they graduate after a course of probably six 
or nine months&rsquo; study as nurses.&nbsp; The object for which these 
colleges were established is entirely ignored by the woman, who, from the 
smattering of medical knowledge she obtains there, seeks to perfect herself
as an abortionist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The principal, and indeed the only object of these wretches is to extort
money from their victims.&nbsp; They have no interest in their 
&ldquo;patients,&rdquo; either scientific or humane, as is shown by the 
<!-- page 624--><a name="page624"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
624</span>readiness with which they consent to risk the lives of the poor 
creatures in their hands, and the rapacity with which they drain their 
money from them.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reader may ask, &ldquo;Why, then, do women seek these 
wretches, instead of applying to educated physicians?&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
answer is plain.&nbsp; Educated physicians are, as a rule, men of honor and
humanity as well as skill.&nbsp; They know that to produce an abortion at 
any stage of pregnancy is to commit murder by destroying the child, and 
they also know that such an act, if it does not endanger the mother&rsquo;s
life at the time, will doom her to great future suffering and disease, and 
probably to a painful death at the &ldquo;turn of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Therefore, as men of honor and good citizens, as well as lovers of science,
they refuse to prostitute their profession and stain their souls with 
crime.</p>
<p>The medicines used by the Professors of Infanticide are in most cases 
such as they know will not produce the relief the patient desires.&nbsp; 
The object of this is to drain the poor woman&rsquo;s purse, first by 
causing her to purchase these medicines, and then to force her to submit to
an operation; for the &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; well knows that the 
&ldquo;pills&rdquo; will &ldquo;do her no good,&rdquo; and that when she 
finds there is no escape from an operation, she will come to him, as he is 
already in possession of her secret.&nbsp; Yet occasionally we find 
powerful and active medicines administered by these wretches; and it may be
said here that all the medicines possessing sufficient power to expel the 
f&oelig;tus prematurely, are also sufficiently powerful to, and invariably 
do, shatter a woman&rsquo;s system to an extent from which she rarely 
recovers.&nbsp; The majority of abortionists, however, prefer to use 
instruments for this purpose, although this is with them the most dangerous
of all means of procuring abortion, many of their victims dying from such 
use of instruments.&nbsp; The most skilful surgeon would be very cautious 
in using an instrument, well knowing that the most practised hand may in a 
few minutes fatally injure a woman; yet these ignorant wretches employ this
means without hesitation.&nbsp; They plead that it is the quickest and 
surest means of accomplishing their object.</p>
<p>It is not flattering to our pride to be told that this crime is <!-- 
page 625--><a name="page625"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 625</span>one 
peculiar to our own country; yet so it is.&nbsp; European communities 
provide asylums in which pregnant women may seek refuge, and, secure from 
the curiosity or censure of their acquaintances, may be safely delivered of
their offspring at the completion of their natural period.&nbsp; Should 
they desire to retain the child, they may do so; but should they be 
unwilling to claim the proof of their shame, the little innocent may be 
placed where it will be cared for and protected by the good Sisters of the 
foundling hospitals, and the mother&rsquo;s hands are thus kept free from 
the blood of her child.&nbsp; One does not see in the Old World the 
journals crowded with such advertisements as we have referred to, or find 
such wretches, either openly or secretly, practising their infamous trade 
there.&nbsp; No European Government would tolerate such a state of affairs,
for if it cannot prevent adultery, it can protect the lives of its 
people.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is in that part of the world a public 
sentiment sufficiently pure in this respect, however it may be in others, 
to prevent such practices.&nbsp; It is only in this land of boasted 
intelligence and freedom that such wretches can thrive, that such practices
can be carried on with the full knowledge of the community, and no 
effectual step be taken to put a stop to them.</p>
<p>That we have presented no over-drawn picture every candid reader will 
confess.&nbsp; If proof is needed the reader has only to turn to the 
advertising columns of the newspapers referred to, and he will find one or 
more of the advertisements we have spoken of.&nbsp; In this city there are 
over twenty of these wretches plying their trade, and advertising it in the
public prints.&nbsp; How well they succeed we have already shown, and in 
order to make it evident how great are their profits, we quote the 
following description of one of the most notorious female abortionists:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By common consent, as well as by reason of her peculiar calling, 
Madam ---, of Fifth avenue, is styled &lsquo;The wickedest woman in New 
York.&rsquo;&nbsp; According to her advertisement in the papers and the 
City Directory, she calls herself a &lsquo;female physician and professor 
of midwifery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam --- is about fifty-five years of age, is a short, <!-- page
626--><a name="page626"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 626</span>plump, 
vulgar-looking woman, with dark, piercing eyes and jet-black hair.&nbsp; 
Once she was handsome, but possesses now no traces of her former 
beauty.&nbsp; She looks like an upstart or &lsquo;shoddy&rsquo; female, but
not particularly wicked or heartless.&nbsp; She commenced business about 
twenty years ago.&nbsp; Her establishment at that time was in C--- street, 
and for some time she was but little known.&nbsp; About four years after 
she had begun business an event occurred which rendered her one of the most
notorious women of the city.&nbsp; A young woman died who had been under 
her treatment, and Madam --- was arrested.&nbsp; She was tried before one 
of the courts, and her trial became a sensation for many days.&nbsp; The 
papers were filled with the testimony in the case, and the arguments of the
leading counsel were given in full.&nbsp; All sorts of accounts, too, were 
furnished as to the history of the accused, the evil of abortion, and the 
necessity of adopting stricter laws in regard to it.&nbsp; There was ample 
testimony offered on which Madam --- could be convicted, but justice at 
that time, as at the present, was open to pecuniary inducements.&nbsp; 
Madam --- had already made considerable money from her improper trade, and 
it was rumored at the time that she purchased a verdict of &lsquo;Not 
Guilty&rsquo; for one hundred thousand dollars.&nbsp; It was a big price to
pay, but she regained her liberty, and, what was more, made money by the 
large investment.&nbsp; Her trial proved to be an immense advertisement for
her, and shortly afterward she removed from C--- street, purchasing a large
mansion on Fifth avenue, not far from the Central Park.&nbsp; In that house
she has lived from that time to the present, and says she intends to remain
there until her death.&nbsp; The building is of brown stone, and is one of 
the finest on the avenue.&nbsp; It is a corner house, five stories high, 
the windows of which command from below a fine view of the Fifth avenue, 
and the Central Park from above.&nbsp; Shades of a most gaudy, though very 
vulgar, pattern, are at the windows.&nbsp; No other house in Fifth avenue 
or in New York possesses such shades, or, indeed, would any one else in the
city want to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam --- purchased this house, it is stated, through an agent in
real estate.&nbsp; She could not have procured it <!-- page 627--><a 
name="page627"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 627</span>otherwise, as the 
owner would have refused to sell it to her on account of her 
business.&nbsp; Property in the neighborhood in which she lives cannot be 
sold for any reasonable figure.&nbsp; The vacant lots on the side of her 
mansion have been offered for several years at reduced prices, but no one 
will take them.&nbsp; Efforts have been made to buy her out, but without 
success; she has been offered many thousand dollars in advance of the price
she paid for her mansion, but she refuses to sell, saying that she bought 
the house not for speculation, but for a home, and she intends to remain 
there as long as she lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her residence is the most magnificently furnished of any 
establishment on Fifth avenue.&nbsp; It is finished and furnished like a 
palace.&nbsp; Each window consists of but two enormous panes of plate 
glass.&nbsp; There are fifty-two windows, hung with satin and French lace 
curtains.&nbsp; Her office is in the basement, where she receives her 
callers.&nbsp; On the first floor are the grand hall of tessellated marble,
lined with mirrors; the three immense dining-rooms, furnished in bronze and
gold, with yellow satin hangings, an enormous French mirror in mosaic 
gilding at every panel; ceilings in medallions and cornices; more parlors 
and reception-rooms; butler&rsquo;s pantry, lined with solid silver 
services; dining-room with all imported furniture.&nbsp; Other parlors on 
the floor above; a guest-chamber in blue brocade satin, with gold-and-ebony
bedstead elegantly covered; boudoir for dressing in every room; madam and 
husband&rsquo;s own room, granddaughter&rsquo;s room, news-room, 
study.&nbsp; Fourth floor&mdash;servants&rsquo; rooms in mahogany and 
Brussels carpet, and circular picture-gallery; the fifth floor contains a 
magnificent billiard-room, dancing-hall, with pictures, piano, etc., and 
commands a fine view of Fifth avenue.&nbsp; The whole house is filled with 
statuettes, paintings, rare bronzes, ornamental and valuable clocks, 
candelabras, silver globes and articles of <i>vertu</i>, chosen with 
unexceptionable taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam --- is a married woman, her husband being Mr. ---, a 
Frenchman.&nbsp; He is in the same business as herself, practising it under
an assumed name, having an office in the lower part of the city, and his 
advertisements are next to madam&rsquo;s <!-- page 628--><a 
name="page628"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 628</span>in the daily 
papers.&nbsp; The interesting couple have a daughter, aged about fifteen, a
blonde and beautiful girl, who looks too pure and good to live in such a 
magnificent den of infamy which is called her home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam --- keeps seven servants and four fast horses.&nbsp; In 
winter she drives in tandem, with large ermine sleigh-robes.&nbsp; On every
afternoon in the summer she may be seen out alone driving in the Central 
Park.&nbsp; Her carriage is noted for its extraordinary showiness.&nbsp; 
There are various statements given as to how she came to adopt her 
profession.&nbsp; One is, that she was once a servant-girl in a large 
boarding-house.&nbsp; A couple left one day, and in cleaning up their room 
the girl, who was afterward to take the name of Madam ---, found a written 
receipt for a certain purpose.&nbsp; That she preserved, afterward 
recommending its use to a female friend, and finding it worked well, opened
her C--- street office, and sold the medicine at a high figure.&nbsp; 
Another story is, that she was once a pretty bar-maid in a tavern in the 
suburbs of London, came to this country when about twenty years of age, 
made the acquaintance of a physician, and acquired some medical knowledge; 
was an astrologer and clairvoyant for a time, and afterward adopted her 
present profession.&nbsp; She is said to have considerable knowledge as to 
her specialty, which is probably the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is said to be worth fully a million of dollars.&nbsp; She has
practised her peculiar branch of medicine for many years, and with uniform 
success.&nbsp; Every one knows it, yet none can bring her to justice.&nbsp;
She is too careful and too rich for that.&nbsp; Her immunity from 
punishment has been entirely owing to the fact that she only takes safe 
cases, never practising on a woman who has been pregnant more than four 
months.&nbsp; Her charge is $500 a case.&nbsp; Need there be any better 
confirmation of the assertion that the rich are greater votaries of the 
crime of abortion than the poor?&nbsp; Yet every crime has its 
punishment.&nbsp; Madame ---&rsquo;s is her loneliness.&nbsp; She has made 
frantic efforts to get into some part of society better than the 
lowest.&nbsp; But the rich women who resort to her for &lsquo;relief&rsquo;
(this is the word used), turn their backs upon her in public.&nbsp; Madame 
--- has a daughter, and <!-- page 629--><a name="page629"></a><span

laying claim to respectability who would marry her.&nbsp; But her daughter 
is yet unmarried.&nbsp; Her eldest daughter ran away and married a 
policeman, and is now happy in being disowned by her own mother.&nbsp; 
Madame --- has her mansion, and carriages and horses, and every luxury 
riches can bring.&nbsp; All but position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet this woman and her associates continue to ply their fearful trade, 
and day after day in this great city this terrible slaughter of innocent 
beings goes on, and it will go on until the law makes the publication of 
the advertisements of these wretches, and the practice of their arts and 
the sale of their drugs, criminal offences.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the best customers of the vendors
of medicines for producing miscarriage and abortion are those who seek to 
hide their shame.&nbsp; It is a terrible fact that here, as in many other 
parts of the country, the crime of destroying their unborn offspring is 
repeatedly practised by married women in the secrecy of domestic 
life.&nbsp; These buy largely of the drugs and pills sold by the 
professional abortionists.&nbsp; New York is bad enough in this respect, 
but the crime is not confined to it.&nbsp; It is an appalling truth that so
many American wives are practicers of the horrible sin of 
&ldquo;prevention&rdquo; that in certain sections of our country, the 
native population is either stationary or is dying out.&nbsp; So common is 
the practice, that the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore and the 
Episcopal Bishop of Western New York, felt themselves called upon, a year 
or two ago, to publicly warn their people of the awful nature of it.</p>
<p>It is fashionable here, as elsewhere, not to have more than one, two, or
three children.&nbsp; Men and women tell their friends every day that they 
do not mean to increase their families.&nbsp; They do mean, however, to 
enjoy the blessings of the married state, and to avoid its 
responsibilities.&nbsp; There is scarcely a physician in the city who is 
not applied to almost daily by persons of good position for advice as to 
the best means of preventing conception.&nbsp; The physicians of New York 
are men of honor, and they not only refuse to comply with the request, but 
<!-- page 630--><a name="page630"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
630</span>warn the applicants for advice as to the true moral and physical 
nature of the course they are seeking to adopt.&nbsp; Yet this warning does
not turn them from their purpose.&nbsp; Failing to secure the assistance of
scientific men, they seek the advice, and purchase the drugs, of the 
wretches whose trade is child murder.&nbsp; The evil grows greater every 
year.&nbsp; These wretches send their drugs all over the country, and 
&ldquo;the American race is dying out.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1865, there were 
780,931 families in the State of New York.&nbsp; Of these, 196,802 families
had no children, 148,208 families had but one child each, 140,572 families 
had but two children each, and 107,342 families had but three children 
each.&nbsp; In nearly one-fourth of all the families there was not a child,
and in 592,924 families, or more than three-fourths of all in the State, 
there was only a small fraction over one child to each family.&nbsp; Only 
about one child to each mother in the State reaches maturity.&nbsp; The New
England States show even a worse state of affairs.</p>
<p>Is it a wonder, then, that Madame --- and her associates grow rich?</p>

631</span>LI.&nbsp; THE EAST RIVER ISLANDS AND THEIR INSTITUTIONS.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; BLACKWELL&rsquo;S ISLAND.</h3>
<p>The three islands lying in the East River are among the most noticeable 
features of New York, and offer many attractions to the visitor to the 
city.&nbsp; They are Blackwell&rsquo;s, Ward&rsquo;s, and Randall&rsquo;s 
islands.&nbsp; Of these, Blackwell&rsquo;s Island is the most 
southern.&nbsp; It is about a mile and three-quarters in length, extending 
from Fifty-first to Eighty-eighth street, and comprises an area of about 
120 acres.&nbsp; It takes its name from the Blackwell family, who once 
owned it, and whose ancestral residence, a tasteful wooden cottage, over a 
hundred years old, stands near the centre of the island, and is occupied by
the Keeper of the Almshouse.&nbsp; The island was purchased by the city, in
1828, for the sum of $30,000.&nbsp; A further outlay of $20,000 was made in
1843 to perfect the title.&nbsp; The land alone is now worth over 
$600,000.&nbsp; The island is surrounded by a granite sea-wall, and has 
been made to slope gradually towards the water on each side by a thorough 
system of grading.&nbsp; This labor was performed by the convicts of the 
Penitentiary, and the inmates of the Workhouse.&nbsp; There is an excellent
dock near the Penitentiary for boats, but no vessels are allowed to land 
here but the boats of the Department of Charities and Corrections.&nbsp; 
Visitors must obtain a permit from this department or they will not be 
allowed to set foot upon the island.&nbsp; The institutions on this and the
other islands are supplied with <!-- page 632--><a name="page632"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 632</span>the Croton water, a large main being carried 
across under the river.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p632.jpg">
<img alt="RESIDENCE OF THE KEEPER OF THE ALMSHOUSE." src="images/p632.jpg" 
/>
</a></p>
<p>On the extreme southern end of the island is a stone building of 
moderate size and handsome design.&nbsp; This is the Small-pox 
Hospital.&nbsp; It was erected in 1854, at a cost of $38,000, and will 
accommodate one hundred patients.&nbsp; It is the only hospital in New York
devoted to small-pox cases, and receives them from all the public and 
private institutions, and from private families.&nbsp; The accommodations 
are excellent, the attention the best.&nbsp; Those who are able to pay are 
required to do so.&nbsp; At the water&rsquo;s edge, on the eastern side of 
this hospital, are several wooden buildings designed for the treatment of 
patients suffering from typhus and ship fever.&nbsp; These will accommodate
one hundred patients, though the number is often greater.</p>
<p>Immediately in the rear of the Small-pox Hospital, though far enough 
from it to be removed from danger, is the Charity Hospital, a magnificent 
structure of gray granite, said to be the largest hospital in 
America.&nbsp; It consists of a central building with two wings, each three
and a half stories in height, with a <!-- page 633--><a 
name="page633"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 633</span>Mansard roof.&nbsp; 
The entire building is 354 feet long, and 122 feet wide.&nbsp; The eastern 
wing is occupied by males, and the western by females.&nbsp; The hospital 
is divided into 29 wards, the smallest of which contains 13 beds, and the 
largest 39.&nbsp; Twelve hundred patients can be accommodated with 
comfort.&nbsp; There are separate wards for the treatment of different 
diseases, and the medical attendance is the best that New York can 
afford.&nbsp; The whole establishment is a model of neatness, and is 
conducted in the most systematic and skilful manner.&nbsp; About seven 
thousand patients are annually treated here, the majority being charity 
patients.&nbsp; The average number of deaths is about four hundred and 
fifty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p633.jpg">
<img alt="SMALL-POX HOSPITAL." src="images/p633.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Back of the Charity Hospital, and extending north and south, or parallel
with the course of the island and river, is the New York Penitentiary, the 
first public institution erected on the island.&nbsp; It is a gloomy and 
massive edifice, constructed of hewn stone and rubble masonry.&nbsp; It is 
four stories in height, and consists of a central building and wings.&nbsp;
The central building is 65 by 75 feet, and the wings each 200 by 50 feet in
size.&nbsp; <!-- page 634--><a name="page634"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
634</span>The entire building is exceedingly strong.&nbsp; The floors are 
of stone, and the stairways and doors of iron.&nbsp; It contains 500 cells 
for men, and 256 for women, but the number of convicts is generally in 
excess of the number of cells, and still greater accommodations are 
needed.&nbsp; It is probable that a new and larger Penitentiary will be 
erected on Hart&rsquo;s Island, in Long Island Sound, about twelve miles 
from Blackwell&rsquo;s Island.&nbsp; The prisoners at this institution are 
sent here by the city courts, for terms of from one to six months.&nbsp; 
Some, however, are sentenced to imprisonment for several years.&nbsp; The 
convicts are all required to labor.&nbsp; Formerly the men were required to
engage in excavating stone from the rich quarries with which the island 
abounded, but which have now been exhausted.&nbsp; The erection of the new 
buildings on Randall&rsquo;s, Ward&rsquo;s, and Hart&rsquo;s islands, 
furnishes constant employment to the convicts, who are daily conveyed 
between the prison and these institutions.&nbsp; Those who are able to work
at the ordinary trades are allowed to do so in the workshops of the 
Penitentiary.&nbsp; The women are required to do sewing, housework, and the
like.</p>

permit from the Commissioners.&nbsp; Sentinels are stationed along the 
water fronts, and guard-boats patrol the river to prevent the escape of the
convicts.&nbsp; In spite of these precautions, however, men have succeeded 
in making their escape to the opposite shore.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The convicts are clothed in a uniform of striped woollen garments, and 
are supplied with a sufficient amount of bedding and with an abundance of 
excellent but plain food.&nbsp; The allowance is about one pound of beef, 
and a quart of vegetable soup at dinner, ten ounces of bread at each meal, 
and one quart of coffee at breakfast and supper, to each man.&nbsp; In 
1869, the total number of prisoners confined here during the year was 
2005.&nbsp; A very large number of those sentenced to the Penitentiary are 
under the age of twenty-five.&nbsp; The proportion of females is about 
one-fifth.&nbsp; The foreigners are a little more than one-half of the 
whole number.&nbsp; A system of evening schools, at which the attendance is
voluntary, has been instituted.&nbsp; The commutation system is also 
practised, by which the prisoner by good <!-- page 637--><a 
name="page637"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 637</span>conduct may receive a
proportionate abridgment of his term of confinement.&nbsp; Such conduct is 
reported every month by the Warden to the Commissioners, who report it to 
the Governor of the State, who alone has the power to shorten the terms in 
the manner mentioned.&nbsp; Religious services are conducted every Sabbath 
by Protestant and Roman Catholic clergymen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p637.jpg">
<img alt="ALMSHOUSE." src="images/p637.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>To the north of the Penitentiary are two handsome and similar structures
of stone, separated by a distance of 650 feet.&nbsp; These are the 
Almshouses.&nbsp; Each consists of a central story, fifty feet square and 
fifty-seven feet high, with a cupola thirty feet in height, and two wings, 
each ninety feet long, sixty feet wide, and forty feet high.&nbsp; Each is 
three stories in height.&nbsp; Each floor is provided with an outside iron 
verandah, with stairways of iron, and each building will furnish 
comfortable quarters for 600 people, adults only being admitted.&nbsp; One 
of these buildings is devoted exclusively to men, the other to women.&nbsp;
Both are kept scrupulously clean, and it is said that they are kept by a 
daily brushing of the beds, which are taken to pieces every morning, 
entirely free from vermin.&nbsp; The grounds are well laid <!-- page 
638--><a name="page638"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 638</span>off, and are
in admirable order.&nbsp; In short, the whole place is a model of neatness 
and careful administration.&nbsp; None but the aged and infirm, who are 
destitute, are admitted.&nbsp; Each newcomer is bathed immediately upon his
or her arrival, and clad in the plain but comfortable garments provided by 
the establishment.&nbsp; He is then taken to the Warden&rsquo;s office, 
where his name, age, and bodily condition are registered.&nbsp; At the same
time, he is given a card inscribed with the number of the ward and the 
class to which he is assigned, this allotment being based upon an 
examination by the House Physician.&nbsp; The inmates are divided into four
classes, as follows: I.&nbsp; Able-bodied men.&nbsp; II.&nbsp; Those who 
are able to do light labor and to act as inspectors or orderlies of the 
different wards.&nbsp; III.&nbsp; Those who are able to sweep the walks or 
break stones.&nbsp; IV.&nbsp; Those who are too old or infirm for any 
labor.&nbsp; Those assigned to the first three classes are compelled to 
perform the duties required of them on pain of dismissal.&nbsp; In the 
female house, the infirm are more numerous than among the males.&nbsp; 
Those able to work are employed in sewing and knitting, in keeping the 
wards in order, and in nursing the feeble and cripples.&nbsp; In 1870, 
there were 1114 persons in the Almshouses, from fifteen years of age 
upwards.&nbsp; A special provision is made in each house for blind 
inmates.</p>
<p>Attached to the Almshouse are the Hospitals for Incurables, which 
consist of two one-story buildings, 175 feet long, and 25 feet wide.&nbsp; 
One is devoted to men and the other to women.&nbsp; In these buildings are 
quartered those who are afflicted with incurable diseases, but who require 
no medical attention.</p>
<p>The Bureau for the Relief of the Outdoor Poor is connected with the 
Almshouse, though it conducts its operations in the city.&nbsp; The city is
divided into eleven districts, each of which is in charge of a visitor, 
subject to the orders of the Superintendent of the Bureau.&nbsp; It is the 
duty of these visitors to examine into the causes of sickness, crime, and 
pauperism in their respective districts, and to report their observations 
to the Superintendent, who communicates them to the Department of Charities
and Corrections.&nbsp; Temporary shelter is given to <!-- page 639--><a 
name="page639"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 639</span>needy persons in the 
winter, and money, fuel, food, clothing, etc., distributed to deserving 
persons.&nbsp; In 1869, 5275 families were given money, and 7555 fuel by 
this Bureau; $128,000 being expended for these charities.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p639.jpg">
<img alt="THE WORKHOUSE." src="images/p639.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In the rear of the Almshouse is the Workhouse, one of the handsomest 
buildings on the island.&nbsp; It is constructed of hewn stone, and 
consists of a central building four stories in height, with a northern and 
a southern wing, with a traverse section across the extreme end of each 
wing.&nbsp; In these traverse sections are located the workshops.&nbsp; The
entire length of the building is 680 feet.&nbsp; Not counting the convict 
labor, the cost of its construction was over $100,000.&nbsp; The stone of 
which it was built was obtained on the island.</p>
<p>In the central building are located the kitchens, and storerooms, the 
private quarters of the Superintendent and the other officials, and a large
and handsome chapel.&nbsp; The wings contain each a broad hall, on each 
side of which are three tiers of cells, one above the other.&nbsp; Iron 
galleries, with stairways, extend along the fronts of these cells, and 
afford access to them.&nbsp; There <!-- page 640--><a 
name="page640"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 640</span>are 150 cells in each
wing.&nbsp; Each cell is provided with an iron grated door, and contains 
four single berths.&nbsp; The cells are separated from each other by brick 
walls.&nbsp; In the workshops, the carpenter&rsquo;s, blacksmith&rsquo;s, 
wheelwright&rsquo;s, tinner&rsquo;s, tailor&rsquo;s, and other trades are 
carried on.&nbsp; The men are also kept at work grading the island, 
building the seawall, and cultivating the gardens.&nbsp; Gangs of laborers 
are sent daily to engage in the works on Ward&rsquo;s and Randall&rsquo;s 
islands.&nbsp; The women are made to do the housework and cleaning of the 
various institutions on the island, and are employed in washing, mending, 
sewing, knitting, etc.&nbsp; All the inmates are obliged to labor.</p>
<p>The number of persons annually sent to the Workhouse is from 15,000 to 
20,000.&nbsp; The vagrant, dissipated, and disorderly classes are sent here
by the city police courts, ten days being the average term of 
commitment.&nbsp; Drunkenness is the principal cause of their detention 
here.&nbsp; Very few are Americans.&nbsp; Of the foreigners, the Irish are 
the most numerous, the Germans next.</p>
<p>Back of the Workhouse, and occupying the extreme upper portion of the 
island, is the New York City Lunatic Asylum.&nbsp; It is a large and 
commodious building, with several out-buildings, with accommodations for 
576 patients.&nbsp; A new Lunatic Asylum is now in course of erection on 
Ward&rsquo;s Island.&nbsp; It is to accommodate 500 patients.&nbsp; It is 
one of the most complete establishments in the country, and is built of 
brick and Ohio freestone.&nbsp; It is a very handsome building, with an 
imposing front of 475 feet.&nbsp; The two asylums will accommodate 1076 
patients, but they are not adequate to the accommodation of all the 
afflicted for whom the city is required to provide.&nbsp; Still further 
accommodations are needed.&nbsp; In 1870, the number of patients committed 
to the care of the Commissioners was over 1300.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; WARD&rsquo;S ISLAND.</h3>
<p>Ward&rsquo;s Island takes its name from Jasper and Bartholomew Ward, who
formerly owned it.&nbsp; It comprises an area of about <!-- page 641--><a 
name="page641"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 641</span>two hundred acres, 
and is owned in about equal portions by the Commissioners of Emigration and
the Department of Charities and Corrections.&nbsp; It is separated from New
York by the Harlem River, from Blackwell&rsquo;s and Long islands by that 
portion of the East River known as Hell Gate, and from Randall&rsquo;s 
Island by a narrow strait called Little Hell Gate.&nbsp; It lies a little 
to the northeast of Blackwell&rsquo;s Island, about half a mile from it, 
and is the widest of the three islands in the East River.</p>
<p>The Emigrant Hospital is described in another chapter.</p>
<p>The new Lunatic Asylum is located on the extreme eastern portion of the 
island.</p>
<p>Between the Emigrant Hospital and the Lunatic Asylum is the New York 
Inebriate Asylum, a handsome brick edifice, three stories in height, with a
frontage of 474 feet, and a depth of 50 feet.&nbsp; It is provided with 
every convenience, is supplied with the Croton water, and has 
accommodations for 400 patients.&nbsp; The patients consist of those who 
either seek the Asylum voluntarily or are placed there by their friends, 
and who pay for their accommodations, and those who are sent to the 
institution by the police authorities for reformation.&nbsp; The treatment 
is moral as well as physical.&nbsp; The physician&rsquo;s efforts to repair
the ravages of dissipation in the physical system are supplemented by the 
labors of the chaplain and the other officers of the institution, who seek 
to revive in the patient a sound, healthy morality, which they strive to 
make the basis of his reformation.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; RANDALL&rsquo;S ISLAND.</h3>
<p>Randall&rsquo;s Island is so called from Jonathan Randall, a former 
owner.&nbsp; It lies about one hundred yards to the north of Ward&rsquo;s 
Island, from which it is separated by Little Hell Gate.&nbsp; The Harlem 
Kills separate it from Westchester county, and the Harlem River from New 
York.&nbsp; About thirty acres of the southern portion are owned by the 
&ldquo;Society for the Reformation <!-- page 643--><a 
name="page643"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 643</span>of Juvenile 
Delinquents.&rdquo;&nbsp; The remainder is the property of the 
&ldquo;Commissioners of Charities and Corrections.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p642.jpg">
<img alt="HOUSE OF REFUGE: RANDALL&rsquo;S ISLAND." src="images/p642.jpg" 
/>
</a></p>
<p>The southern portion is occupied by the &ldquo;House of Refuge,&rdquo; 
which is under the control of the &ldquo;Society for the Reformation of 
Juvenile Delinquents.&rdquo;&nbsp; The buildings are of brick, and are 
constructed in the Italian style.&nbsp; They have a frontage of nearly 1000
feet, and were constructed at a cost of about $500,000.&nbsp; They 
constitute one of the handsomest public institutions in the city.&nbsp; The
main buildings contain 886 dormitories, several spacious and fully 
furnished school rooms, a handsome chapel, which will seat 1000 persons, 
the kitchens, hospital, and officers&rsquo; quarters.&nbsp; The average 
number of inmates is about 700 boys and 150 girls.&nbsp; Every child is 
compelled to labor from six to eight hours every day in the week, and to 
attend school from four to five hours.&nbsp; The inmates consist of such 
juvenile offenders against the law as the courts commit to the Refuge in 
preference to sending them to prison.&nbsp; Some of them are young people, 
whose parents, unable to manage them, and wishing to save them from lives 
of sin and crime, have placed them in the hands of the Society for 
reformation.&nbsp; The discipline is mainly reformatory, though the inmates
are subjected to the restraints, but not the degradation of a prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys&rsquo; building is divided into two compartments; the 
first division, in the one, is thus entirely separated from the second 
division in the other compartment.&nbsp; The second division is composed of
those whose characters are decidedly bad, or whose offence was great.&nbsp;
A boy may, by good conduct, however, get promoted from the second into the 
first division.&nbsp; As a rule, the second division is much older than the
first.&nbsp; Each division is divided into four grades.&nbsp; Every boy on 
entering the Reformatory is placed in the third grade; if he behaves well, 
he is placed in the second in a week, and a month after in the first grade;
if he continues in a satisfactory course for three months, he is placed in 
the grade of honor, and wears a badge on his breast.&nbsp; Every boy in the
first division must remain six months, in the second division twelve months
in the first grade, before he can be indentured to any trade.&nbsp; These 
two divisions <!-- page 644--><a name="page644"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 644</span>are under the charge of twenty-five teachers 
and twenty-five guards.&nbsp; At half-past six o&rsquo;clock the cells are 
all unlocked, every one reports himself to the overseer, and then goes to 
the lavatories; at seven, after parading, they are marched to the school 
rooms to join in the religious exercises for half an hour; at half-past 
seven, they have breakfast, and at eight are told off to the workshops, 
where they remain till twelve, when they again parade, previous to going to
dinner.&nbsp; For dinner they have a large plate of soup, a small portion 
of meat, a small loaf of bread, and a mug of water.&nbsp; At one 
o&rsquo;clock, they return to their work.&nbsp; When they have completed 
their allotted task, they are allowed to play till four, when they have 
supper.&nbsp; At half-past four they go to school, where they remain till 
eight o&rsquo;clock, the time for going to bed.&nbsp; Each boy has a 
separate cell, which is locked and barred at night.&nbsp; The cells are in 
long, lofty, well ventilated corridors, each corridor containing one 
hundred cells.&nbsp; The doors of the cells are all grated, in order that 
the boys may have light and air, and also be under the direct supervision 
of the officers, who, though very strict, apparently know well how to 
temper strictness with kindness.&nbsp; Before going to bed, half an hour is
again devoted to religious exercises, singing hymns, reading the Bible, 
etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most interesting, and at the same time, one of the 
most important features of the Refuge, is the workshop.&nbsp; On entering 
the shop, the visitor is amused by finding a lot of little urchins occupied
in making ladies&rsquo; hoopskirts of the latest fashionable design; nearly
100 are engaged in the crinoline department.&nbsp; In the same long room, 
about fifty are weaving wire for sifting cotton, making wire sieves, 
rat-traps, gridirons, flower baskets, cattle noses, etc.&nbsp; The 
principal work, however, is carried on in the boot and shoe 
department.&nbsp; The labor of the boys is let out to contractors, who 
supply their own foremen to teach the boys and superintend the work, but 
the society have their own men to keep order and correct the boys when 
necessary, the contractors&rsquo; men not being allowed to interfere with 
them in any way whatever.&nbsp; There are 590 boys in this 
department.&nbsp; They manage on an average to turn out about <!-- page 
645--><a name="page645"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 645</span>2500 pairs 
of boots and shoes daily, which are mostly shipped to the Southern 
States.&nbsp; Each one has a certain amount of work allotted to him in the 
morning, which he is bound to complete before four o&rsquo;clock in the 
afternoon.&nbsp; Some are quicker and more industrious than others, and 
will get their work done by two o&rsquo;clock; this gives two hours&rsquo; 
play to those in the first division, the second division have to go to 
school when they have finished, till three o&rsquo;clock, they only being 
allowed one hour for recreation.&nbsp; The authorities are very anxious to 
make arrangements to have a Government vessel stationed off the island, to 
be used as a training-ship for the most adventurous spirits.&nbsp; If this 
design is carried out it will be a very valuable adjunct to the working of 
the institution, and will enable the Directors to take in many more boys, 
without incurring the expense of extending the present buildings.&nbsp; The
girls are also employed in making hoopskirts, in making clothes for 
themselves and the boys, in all sorts of repairing, in washing linen, and 
in general housework.&nbsp; The girls are generally less tractable than the
boys; perhaps this is accounted for by their being older, some of them 
being as much as five or six and twenty.&nbsp; The boys average about 
thirteen or fourteen, the girls seventeen or eighteen years of age.&nbsp; 
Nearly two-thirds of the boys have been bootblacks, the remainder mostly 
&lsquo;wharf rats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Directors of the House of Refuge, while having a due regard 
for the well-being of its inmates, very properly take care that they are 
not so comfortable or so well-fed as to lead them to remain longer in the 
reformatory than necessary.&nbsp; As soon as the boys appear to be really 
reformed, they are indentured out to farmers and different trades.&nbsp; In
the year 1867, no less than 633 boys and 146 girls were started in life in 
this way.&nbsp; Any person wishing to have a child indentured to him, has 
to make a formal application to the Committee to that effect, at the same 
time giving references as to character, etc.&nbsp; Inquiries are made, and 
if satisfactorily answered, the child is handed over to his custody, the 
applicant engaging to feed, clothe, and educate his young apprentice.&nbsp;
The boy&rsquo;s new master has to forward a written report to the officer, 
as to his health and general <!-- page 646--><a name="page646"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 646</span>behaviour from time to time.&nbsp; If the boy 
does not do well, he is sent back to the Refuge, and remains there till he 
is twenty-one years of age.&nbsp; Most of the children, however, get on, 
and many of them have made for themselves respectable positions in 
society.&nbsp; The annals of the Society in this respect are very 
gratifying and interesting.&nbsp; Many young men never lose sight of a 
Refuge which rescued them in time from a criminal life, and to which they 
owe almost their very existence.&nbsp; Instead of alternating between the 
purlieus of Water street and Sing Sing, they are many of them in a fair way
to make a fortune.&nbsp; One young man who was brought up there, and is now
thriving, lately called at the office to make arrangements for placing his 
two younger brothers in the House, they having got into bad company since 
their father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; A very remarkable occurrence took place 
at the institution not long ago.&nbsp; A gentleman and his wife, apparently
occupying a good position in society, called at the Refuge and asked to be 
allowed to go over it.&nbsp; Having inspected the various departments, just
before leaving, the gentleman said to his wife, &lsquo;Now I will tell you 
a great secret.&nbsp; I was brought up in this place.&rsquo;&nbsp; The lady
seemed much surprised, and astounded all by quietly observing, &lsquo;And 
so was I.&rsquo;&nbsp; So strange are the coincidences of human 
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The institutions on this island controlled by the Department of Public 
Charities and Corrections, are the &ldquo;Nurseries,&rdquo; the 
&ldquo;Infant Hospital,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Idiot Asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Nurseries consist of six large Brick buildings, each three stories 
in height, arranged without reference to any special plan, and separated 
from each other by a distance of several hundred feet.&nbsp; Each is in 
charge of an assistant matron, the whole being under the supervision of a 
Warden and matron.&nbsp; These nurseries are devoted to the care of 
children over four years old, abandoned by their parents, and found in the 
streets by the police, and children whose parents are unable to care for 
them.&nbsp; Wherever the parent is known the Commissioners afford only 
temporary shelter to the children, requiring the parents to resume their 
care of them at the earliest possible moment.&nbsp; Three months is the 
limit for gratuitous shelter in such cases.&nbsp; Where <!-- page 647--><a 
name="page647"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 647</span>the parent is 
unknown, the child is cared for until it is of an age to be apprenticed, or
until some respectable persons take it for adoption.&nbsp; Only healthy 
children are received into the nurseries, and none may remain in them after
reaching the age of sixteen years.&nbsp; The average number of inmates is 
about 2400 per annum.</p>
<p>The Infant Hospital is for the reception of children under the age of 
four years, for foundlings, for children whose parents are too poor to take
care of them, and for the sick of the Nurseries proper.&nbsp; The children 
are divided into three classes: I.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Wet nursed:&rdquo; 
II.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Bottle fed:&rdquo; III.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Walking 
Children.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are retained here unless claimed by their 
parents until they attain the age of three or four years, when they are 
transferred to the Nurseries mentioned above.&nbsp; The Hospital is a large
and handsome brick building, and will accommodate several hundred children 
and their nurses.</p>
<p>The Idiot Asylum is a large brick building, with accommodations for 
several hundred patients.&nbsp; It contains at present about 150 of these, 
whose ages vary from six to thirty years.&nbsp; They represent nearly all 
the different phases of idiocy, and are well cared for.&nbsp; Some of them 
have been greatly improved in mind by the treatment and discipline 
pursued.</p>

<p>It would be simply impossible to present within the limits of a single 
chapter, or indeed in half a dozen chapters of the size of this, a 
description of the Benevolent and Charitable Institutions of New 
York.&nbsp; We can do no more than glance at them.&nbsp; Besides the 
institutions already mentioned, there are twenty-one hospitals, 
twenty-three asylums, seventeen homes, five missions, industrial schools, 
and miscellaneous societies, making a total of sixty-six institutions, or 
with those already noticed, a total of nearly one hundred benevolent, 
charitable, penal, and reformatory institutions supported by the city and 
people of New York.</p>
<p>Among the hospitals the largest and oldest is the New York Hospital, 
formerly located on Broadway opposite Pearl street.&nbsp; The Hospital is 
in charge of the medical faculty of the University of New York.&nbsp; At 
present the operations of this institution are entirely suspended, and will
not be resumed until the completion of new buildings, the old ones having 
been sold and pulled down.</p>
<p>The Bloomingdale Asylum for the Insane, is a branch of the New York 
Hospital.&nbsp; It is situated on One-hundred-and-seventeenth street, 
between Tenth and Eleventh avenues.&nbsp; It is one of the most complete 
establishments in the world, and is admirably conducted.</p>
<p>Bellevue Hospital, on the East River, at the foot of Twenty-sixth 
street, is one of the largest in the city.&nbsp; It will accommodate 1200 
patients, and is conducted by the Commissioners of Charities and 
Corrections.&nbsp; There is no charge for treatment and attendance, 
everything being free.&nbsp; The hospital is in charge <!-- page 649--><a 
name="page649"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 649</span>of the most 
distinguished physicians of the city, and as a school of clinical 
instruction ranks among the first in the world.&nbsp; The course is open to
the students of all the medical schools in the city.</p>

<p>St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, on Fifty-fourth street and Fifth avenue, is a
noble institution, and one of the prettiest places on the great 
thoroughfare of fashion.&nbsp; Its erection is due to the labors of the 
Rev. Dr. W. A. Muhlenberg.&nbsp; It is the property of the Episcopal 
Church, by which body it is conducted.&nbsp; The sick are nursed here by 
the &ldquo;Sisters of the Holy Communion,&rdquo; a voluntary association of
unmarried Protestant ladies.&nbsp; The hospital has accommodations for over
one hundred patients, and is said to be the best conducted of any 
denominational charity in the city.&nbsp; Patients who are able to pay are 
required to do so, but the poor are received without charge.</p>
<p>The Roosevelt Hospital, a magnificent structure, is situated on West 
Fifty-ninth street, between Ninth and Tenth avenues, and is to furnish, 
when completed, accommodations for 600 patients.&nbsp; It is the gift of 
the late Jas. H. Roosevelt of New York to the suffering.</p>

<p>The Presbyterian Hospital, on Seventy-first street, between Fourth and 
Madison avenues, is not yet completed.&nbsp; It is a beautiful structure, 
and is to have accommodations for several hundred patients.&nbsp; It is the
property of the Presbyterian Church of New York.&nbsp; The site, valued at 
$250,000, and a further sum of $250,000 in cash, were the gift of Mr. James
Lenox.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church conducts the Hospitals of St. Francis and St. 
Vincent, the former on East Fifth street, and the latter on the corner of 
Eleventh street and Seventh avenue.&nbsp; These two institutions contain 
about 250 beds.</p>
<p>The German Hospital, Seventy-seventh street and Fourth avenue, is, as 
yet, incomplete.&nbsp; It was erected by the German citizens of New York, 
but receives patients of every nationality and color.&nbsp; The poor are 
received without charge under certain restrictions.&nbsp; There are 
accommodations for about seventy-five patients in the present 
buildings.&nbsp; Connected with the hospital is a dispensary from which 
medical advice and medicines are given to the poor.</p>

present Hebrew Hospital, in Twenty-eighth street, near Eighth avenue, 
contains about sixty-five beds.&nbsp; The Jews also have a burial ground, 
in which those of their faith who die in the Hospital are buried without 
expense to their friends.</p>
<p>The Child&rsquo;s Hospital, Lexington avenue and Fiftieth street, 
embraces four distinct charities: A Foundling Asylum, a Nursery for the 
children of laboring women, a Child&rsquo;s Hospital, and a Lying-in 
Asylum.&nbsp; The buildings are very extensive.&nbsp; The annual Charity 
Ball is given in behalf of this institution.</p>
<p>The Woman&rsquo;s Hospital of the State of New York, Fourth avenue and 
Fiftieth street, is a handsome building, and the only institution of its 
kind in the country.&nbsp; It owes its existence to the exertions of Dr. J.
Marion Sims, who is, together with Dr. Emmett, still in charge of it.&nbsp;
It is devoted exclusively to the treatment of female diseases.&nbsp; It is 
attended by physicians from all parts of the country, who come to receive 
clinical instruction in this branch of their profession.</p>

655</span>LIII.&nbsp; HENRY WARD BEECHER.</h2>
<p>Although Mr. Beecher is a resident of Brooklyn, and although Plymouth 
Church is located in that city, yet the great preacher is sufficiently 
bound to New York by business and socialities to make him a part of the 
great metropolis.</p>
<p>He was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, on the 24th of June, 1813, and 
is now in his fifty-ninth year, though he looks very much younger.&nbsp; He
was the eighth child of Dr. Lyman Beecher, and was regarded as the dunce of
the family, and, according to his own account, had the usual unpleasant 
experience of ministers&rsquo; children.&nbsp; Being of a naturally strong,
vigorous constitution, his body far outran his mind, and the little fellow 
lagged behind until nature asserted her rights.&nbsp; The forcing process 
accomplished very little with him.&nbsp; He was quick-witted, however, and 
fond of fun.&nbsp; The gloomy doctrines of his learned father made him 
shudder, and he came to the conclusion that Sunday was a day of penance, 
and the Catechism a species of torture invented for the punishment of dull 
boys.&nbsp; At the age of ten, he was sent to a boarding-school in 
Bethlehem, where he studied by shouldering his gun and going after 
partridges.&nbsp; Then his sister, Catharine, took him in hand, but he 
spent his time in teazing the girls of her school, and she was compelled to
give him up as a hopeless case.&nbsp; The boy of ten could not be made a 
mental prodigy, do what they would.&nbsp; The result is that the man of 
fifty-nine is as fresh and vigorous in body and mind as most others are at 
thirty-five.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p3.jpg">
<img alt="HENRY WARD BEECHER." src="images/p3.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 656--><a name="page656"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
656</span>When he was twelve years old, his father removed to Boston, and 
there Henry began to show his true powers.&nbsp; He learned rapidly, and 
was soon sent to the Mount Pleasant Institute, at Amherst, from which he 
passed to Amherst College, where he graduated with distinction in 
1834.&nbsp; While at Mount Pleasant, he formed the resolution of entering 
the ministry, and all his studies were thenceforward shaped to that 
end.&nbsp; In 1832, his father had removed to Cincinnati, to assume the 
presidency of the Lane Theological Seminary, and, after leaving Amherst, 
Henry followed him to the West, and completed his theological course at the
Lane Seminary in 1836.&nbsp; In that year he was admitted to the ministry 
of the Presbyterian Church.</p>
<p>Immediately after his ordination, Mr. Beecher married, and accepted a 
call to Lawrenceburg, Indiana, on the Ohio River, twenty miles below 
Cincinnati.&nbsp; He did not stay there long, but passed to the charge of a
church in Indianapolis, where he spent eight years&mdash;eight valuable 
years to him, for he says he learned how to preach there.&nbsp; In the 
summer of 1847, he received and accepted a call to the pastorate of 
Plymouth Church, in Brooklyn, which had just been founded, and on the 11th 
of November, 1847, he was publicly installed in the position which he has 
since held.</p>
<p>Few persons of education and taste ever come to New York without hearing
the great preacher.&nbsp; Plymouth Church is a familiar place to 
them.&nbsp; It is located in Orange street, between Hicks and Henry 
streets, Brooklyn.&nbsp; It is a plain structure of red brick.&nbsp; The 
interior is as simple as the exterior.&nbsp; It is a plain, square room, 
with a large gallery extending entirely around it.&nbsp; At the upper end 
is a platform on which stands the pulpit&mdash;an exquisitely carved little
stand of wood from the Garden of Gethsemane.&nbsp; In the gallery, back of 
the pulpit, is the organ, one of the grandest instruments in the 
country.&nbsp; The seats are arranged in semicircles.&nbsp; By placing 
chairs in the aisles, the house will seat with comfort twenty five hundred 
people.&nbsp; The congregation usually numbers about three thousand, every 
available place being crowded.&nbsp; The upholstering is in crimson, and 
contrasts well with the prevailing white color of the interior.</p>
<p>The singing is congregational, and is magnificent.&nbsp; One never hears
such singing outside of Plymouth Church.</p>
<p><!-- page 657--><a name="page657"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
657</span>The gem of the whole service, however, is the sermon; and these 
sermons are characteristic of the man.&nbsp; They come warm and fresh from 
his heart, and they go home to the hearer, giving him food for thought for 
days afterward.&nbsp; Mr. Beecher talks to his people of what they have 
been thinking of during the week, of trials that have perplexed them, and 
of joys which have blessed them.&nbsp; He takes the merchant and the clerk 
to task for their conduct in the walks of business, and warns them of the 
snares and pitfalls which lie along their paths.&nbsp; He strips the thin 
guise of honesty from the questionable transactions of Wall street, and 
holds them up to public scorn.&nbsp; His dramatic power is 
extraordinary.&nbsp; He can hardly be responsible for it, since it breaks 
forth almost without his will.&nbsp; He moves his audience to tears, or 
brings a mirthful smile to their lips, with a power that is 
irresistible.&nbsp; His illustrations and figures are drawn chiefly from 
nature, and are fresh and striking.&nbsp; He can startle his hearers with 
the terrors of the law, but he prefers to preach the gospel of love.&nbsp; 
His sermons are printed weekly in the <i>Plymouth Pulpit</i>, and are read 
by thousands.</p>
<p>His literary labors, apart from his ministerial duties, have been 
constant.&nbsp; He has published several books, has edited <i>The 
Independent</i> and <i>The Christian Union</i>, and has contributed 
regularly to the <i>New York Ledger</i> and other papers.&nbsp; He has been
almost constantly in the lecture field, and has spoken frequently before 
public assemblies on the various questions of the day.</p>
<p>Mr. Beecher is young-looking and vigorous.&nbsp; He has the face of a 
great orator, and one that is well worth studying.&nbsp; He dresses 
plainly, with something of the farmer in his air, and lives simply.&nbsp; 
He is blessed with robust health, and, like his father, is fond of vigorous
exercise.&nbsp; He has a fine farm on the Hudson, to which he repairs in 
the summers.&nbsp; Here he can indulge his love of nature without 
restraint.&nbsp; He is said to be a capital farmer, though he complains 
that he does not find the pursuit any more remunerative than does his 
friend, Mr. Greeley.</p>
<h2><!-- page 658--><a name="page658"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
658</span>LIV.&nbsp; BLACK-MAILING.</h2>
<p>To live at the expense of other people, and to procure the means of 
living in comfort without working for it, is an art in which there are many
proficients in New York.&nbsp; Certain of those who practise this art are 
known in city parlance as &ldquo;Black-mailers,&rdquo; and they constitute 
one of the most dangerous portions of the community.&nbsp; The Blackmailer 
is generally a woman, though she is frequently sustained or urged on by a 
rough, professional thief, or pick-pocket.&nbsp; The indiscretions of men 
of nominally spotless character are constantly becoming known through the 
instrumentality of the gossips, and as soon as these reach the ears of the 
Blackmailers, who are ever on the watch for them, they proceed to take 
advantage of them to extort money from the person implicated.&nbsp; They 
are not content, however, with making victims of those who are really 
guilty of indiscretions, but boldly assail the innocent and virtuous, 
well-knowing that nine persons out of ten, though guiltless of wrongdoing, 
will sooner comply with their demands than incur the annoyance of a public 
scandal.&nbsp; Such persons think the wretch will never dare to charge them
with the same offence or endeavor to extort money from them a second time, 
and make the first payment merely to rid themselves of the annoyance.&nbsp;
They ought never to yield, whether innocent or guilty, for the Blackmailer 
is sure to repeat her demand.&nbsp; The law makes it a crime for any one to
endeavor to extort money in this way, and no person so threatened should 
hesitate to apply to the police for protection.</p>
<p>As a rule, the Blackmailer is easily driven off with the aid of the 
police, but sometimes her plans are so skilfully laid that it <!-- page 
659--><a name="page659"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 659</span>requires all
the ingenuity of the most experienced detectives to ferret out the 
plot.&nbsp; These women act upon the well-established fact that respectable
people dread scandal, and that a man guilty of an indiscretion will make 
many sacrifices to conceal it.&nbsp; They rarely assail women, as there is 
not much money to be made out of them, but they know that almost any story 
about a man will be believed, and they fasten themselves like leeches upon 
men.&nbsp; Young men about to make rich marriages are their favorite 
victims.&nbsp; These generally yield to them, not caring to risk a scandal 
which might break off the whole affair.&nbsp; If a young man refuses one of
them on such occasions, she goes boldly to the lady he is to marry, and 
declares herself the innocent and wronged victim of the aforesaid young 
man.&nbsp; This is her revenge, and the majority of young men, knowing them
to be capable of such a course, comply with their demands on the 
spot.&nbsp; There is nothing these wretches will not do, no place they will
not invade, in order to extort money from their victims.</p>
<p>Persons from the country, stopping at the hotels of the city, are 
frequently the objects of the attacks of the Blackmailers.&nbsp; A 
man&rsquo;s name is learned from the hotel register, and he is boldly 
approached and charged with conduct he never dreamed of being guilty 
of.&nbsp; The scoundrel professes to know him and his whole family, and 
names the price of his silence.&nbsp; Too often the demand is complied 
with, and the money paid.&nbsp; The proper course to pursue when accosted 
in such a manner, is to call upon the nearest policeman for assistance in 
shaking off the wretch.</p>
<p>A few years ago a minister, in charge of a prominent and wealthy city 
church abruptly left the city.&nbsp; There had never been a whisper of any 
kind of scandal connected with his name, and his friends were at a loss to 
account for his strange action.&nbsp; He refused, at first, when his 
retreat was discovered, to give any reason for his conduct, and begged that
his hiding-place should be kept secret.&nbsp; At length, however, he 
confessed that he was the innocent victim of a female Blackmailer.&nbsp; He
was a weak man, proud of his reputation, and more than usually timid in 
such matters.&nbsp; The woman had approached him, and <!-- page 660--><a 
name="page660"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 660</span>had boldly charged 
him with a crime of which he was innocent, and had demanded a sum of money 
as the price of her silence.&nbsp; Finding it impossible to get rid of her,
and dreading a scandal, the minister had paid the money.&nbsp; The demand 
was repeated again and again for two years, until the woman had wrung from 
her victim a sum of several thousand dollars, and had driven him to such a 
state of despair that he had abandoned his home and his prospects, and had 
fled to escape from her clutches.&nbsp; His friends came to his aid, and by
securing the interposition of the police, compelled the woman to relinquish
her hold upon her victim.</p>
<p>Many of the female Blackmailers are very young, mere girls.&nbsp; A 
couple of years ago, Police Captain Thorne discovered a regularly organized
band of them.&nbsp; They are mostly flower girls, from twelve to sixteen 
years of age.&nbsp; They are generally modest in demeanor, and some of them
are attractive in appearance.&nbsp; They gain admittance to the offices and
counting rooms of professional men and merchants, under the pretext of 
selling their flowers, and then, if the gentleman is alone, close the door,
and threaten to scream and accuse him of taking improper liberties with 
them, unless he consents to pay them the sum they demand.</p>
<p>A merchant of great wealth, high position, and irreproachable character,
called upon Captain Thorne, about two years ago, and &ldquo;frankly stated 
that he was the victim of one of these flower girls, who had already 
despoiled him of large sums of money, and whose persecutions were actually 
killing him.&nbsp; It appears that she always came to his counting-house on
particular days, and, watching until he was alone, went boldly into his 
private office.&nbsp; In police parlance, they &lsquo;put up a job on 
her.&rsquo;&nbsp; Captain Thorne was secreted in the office the next time 
she called, and the gentleman talked to her as previously arranged.&nbsp; 
He began by asking her why she persisted in her demands upon him, for, said
he, &lsquo;you know I never had anything to do with you, never said an 
improper word to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; The young analyst of human nature 
answered, unabashed, &lsquo;I know that; but who&rsquo;ll believe you if I 
say you did?&rsquo;&nbsp; Captain Thorne, dressed in full police <!-- page 
661--><a name="page661"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 661</span>uniform, 
stepped from the closet with, &lsquo;I will for one, Mary.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
girl, young as she was, had experience enough in devious ways to see that 
her game had escaped, and readily, although sullenly, promised to cease 
exacting tribute in that particular quarter.&nbsp; The gentleman would go 
no further, and to the earnest entreaties of Captain Thorne to prosecute 
the girl, both for her own good and that of society, returned an absolute 
refusal.&nbsp; Captain Thorne was, therefore, obliged to let her go with a 
warning not to attempt her operations again anywhere.&nbsp; He also 
remonstrated with her upon her way of living, and asked her why she did 
such things.&nbsp; The hardened girl morosely answered that all the other 
girls did them, and thus gave a clue which was followed until it developed 
a gang of feminine blackmailers of tender years, working in concert.&nbsp; 
Although the band was then dispersed, the method of robbery it employed 
survived, and is yet extensively used by scores of girls, under the cover 
of selling not only flowers, but apples and other fruits.&rdquo;</p>

She consults you on all affairs of life.&nbsp; Born with a natural gift, 
she tells past, present, and future; she brings together those long

fail.&nbsp; She tells his name; also lucky numbers free of charge.&nbsp; 
She succeeds when all others fail.&nbsp; Two thousand dollars reward for 
any one that can equal her in professional skill.&nbsp; Ladies, fifty cents

Avenue.</p>
<p>It seems strange that, in this boasted age of enlightenment, the persons
who make such announcements as the above can find any one simple enough to 
believe them.&nbsp; Yet, it is a fact, that these persons, who are 
generally women, frequently make large sums of money out of the credulity 
of their fellow creatures.&nbsp; Every mail brings them letters from 
persons in various parts of the country.&nbsp; These letters are generally 
answered, and the contents have disgusted more than one simpleton.&nbsp; 
The information furnished is such as any casual <!-- page 663--><a 
name="page663"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 663</span>acquaintance could 
give, and just as trustworthy as the reports of the &ldquo;reliable 
gentleman just from the front,&rdquo; used to prove during the late 
war.&nbsp; The city custom of these impostors is about equal to that 
brought to them from the country by means of their advertisements.&nbsp; 
Some of them make as much as one hundred dollars per day, all of which is a
clear profit.&nbsp; The majority earn from three to six dollars per 
day.&nbsp; Servant girls are profitable customers.&nbsp; Indeed, but for 
female credulity the business would go down.</p>
<p>Still, there are many male visitors.&nbsp; Speculators, victims of the 
gaming table and the lottery, come to ask for advice, which is given at 
random.&nbsp; The woman knows but little of her visitors, and has no means 
of learning anything about them.&nbsp; Sometimes her statements are found 
to be true, but it is by the merest accident.</p>
<p>The clairvoyants do not hesitate to confess to their friends, in a 
confidential way, of course, that their pretensions are mere humbuggery, 
and they laugh at the credulity of their victims, whilst they encourage 
it.&nbsp; It seems absurd to discuss this subject seriously.&nbsp; We can 
only say to those who shall read this chapter, that there is not in the 
City of New York an honest fortune-teller or clairvoyant.&nbsp; They 
knowingly deceive persons as to their powers.&nbsp; It is not given to 
human beings to read the future&mdash;certainly not to such wretched 
specimens as the persons who compose the class of which we are 
writing.&nbsp; The only sensible plan is to keep your money, dear 
reader.&nbsp; You know more than these impostors can possibly tell you.</p>
<p>Many of these fortune-tellers and clairvoyants are simply 
procuresses.&nbsp; They draw women into their houses, and ply them so with 
temptations, that they frequently ruin them.&nbsp; This is the real 
business of most of them.&nbsp; They are leagued with the keepers of houses
of ill-fame.&nbsp; No woman is safe who enters their doors.</p>
<p>The women also offer for sale &ldquo;amulets,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;charms,&rdquo; or &ldquo;recipes,&rdquo; which they declare will 
enable a person to win the love of any one of the opposite sex, and excite 
the admiration of friends; or which will &ldquo;give you an influence over 
your <!-- page 664--><a name="page664"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
664</span>enemies or rivals, moulding them to your own will or 
purpose;&rdquo; or which will &ldquo;enable you to discover lost, stolen, 
or hidden treasures,&rdquo; etc., etc.&nbsp; For each or any of these 
charms, from three to five dollars is asked, &ldquo;with return 
postage,&rdquo; when sent by mail.&nbsp; All these, as well as &ldquo;love 
powders,&rdquo; &ldquo;love elixirs,&rdquo; and the like, are either 
worthless, or are composed of dangerous chemical substances.&nbsp; Strange 
to say, the sale of these things is large.&nbsp; The world is full of 
fools, and the best proof of it is that two of the most noted women of New 
York, who practise the arts we have described, are worth respectively one 
hundred thousand dollars and eighty thousand dollars.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; MATRIMONIAL BROKERS.</h3>
<p>There are several women in the city who advertise to introduce strangers
into the best society, and to procure wives and husbands from the same 
element for their customers.&nbsp; As a general rule, these women are 
simply procuresses.&nbsp; If, however, a man desiring to marry a woman in 
this city, seeks their aid, they will always find some means of assisting 
him.&nbsp; The charge for their services is either a percentage on the 
lady&rsquo;s fortune, or a certain specified sum.&nbsp; The woman, or 
broker, will devise some means of making the acquaintance of the lady 
against whom her arts are to be directed, and will proceed cautiously, step
by step, until she has caused her victim to meet the man for whom she is 
working.&nbsp; The arts used vary according to circumstances, but they 
rarely fail of success.&nbsp; Men who wish to accomplish the ruin of some 
innocent girl, also seek the aid of these brokers, and frequently, through 
their assistance, effect their purpose.&nbsp; If it is necessary, the 
victim, after being allured to the broker&rsquo;s house, is drugged.&nbsp; 
These women are the vampires of society.&nbsp; It is very difficult for the
authorities to make a case against them, and they generally go 
unpunished.</p>
<p>The offers of these wretches to procure wives for men wishing to be 
married, are often accepted by simpletons living in <!-- page 665--><a 
name="page665"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 665</span>country 
districts.&nbsp; The fool is induced to come to the city, where he is 
introduced to a woman who is perhaps a prostitute, or a servant girl, or 
one who is willing to marry any man who will support her.&nbsp; She readily
enters into the arrangement proposed by the broker, and marries the silly 
fellow, who goes back to his rural home with her, thinking he has married a
lady.</p>

666</span>LVI.&nbsp; EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE FREE SCHOOLS.</h3>
<p>The provision made by the city and the people of New York for the 
education of the young is in keeping with their metropolitan 
character.&nbsp; The public and private schools are numerous, and are well 
supported.</p>
<p>The first in importance are the Public or Free Schools, which are 
acknowledged to be the best in the Union.&nbsp; The Free School system is 
under the control of a Board of Education, whose offices are located in a 
handsome brown stone building at the northwest corner of Grand and Elm 
streets.&nbsp; The Board consists of twelve Commissioners, who have the 
general supervision of the schools, the disbursement of the moneys 
appropriated for the cause of education, the purchase of sites and the 
erection of new buildings, the purchase and distribution of books, 
stationery, fuel, lights, and all supplies needed by the schools.&nbsp; 
There are also five Trustees for each ward, or 110 in all, who were, until 
recently, chosen by the people.&nbsp; Besides these, are twenty-one 
Inspectors of Schools, who were, until recently, appointed by the Mayor and
confirmed by the people.&nbsp; The charter of 1870, however, changed the 
whole system, and gave to the Mayor the power of appointing all the 
officers named above, taking the control of the school system entirely out 
of the hands of the people.&nbsp; It is needless to add this was the work 
of the Ring, and was done to secure to them additional power and 
plunder.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 667--><a name="page667"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 667</span>
<a href="images/p667.jpg">
<img alt="A NEW YORK FREE SCHOOL." src="images/p667.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>There are about one hundred buildings in the city used by the public 
schools.&nbsp; About eighty-five of these are owned by the city; the others
are rented.&nbsp; The property under the charge of the Board of Education 
is valued at more than $10,000,000.&nbsp; The annual expenditure for the 
support of the schools averages $3,000,000.&nbsp; In 1869 it was 
$3,136,136.&nbsp; Of this sum, $1,759,634, represented teachers&rsquo; 
salaries; $41,908, was for the support of the colored schools; and 
$164,717, was for the purchase of school apparatus, maps, globes, 
blackboards, books, etc.&nbsp; The teachers employed in the public schools 
number 2500, a large proportion being women, The average annual attendance 
of pupils is 225,000.</p>
<p>The school buildings are generally of brick, tastefully trimmed with 
brown stone, though some of those more recently erected are entirely of 
brown or Ohio stone.&nbsp; They are among <!-- page 668--><a 
name="page668"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 668</span>the most handsome 
edifices in the city.&nbsp; They are generally four stories in height, with
a frontage of 100 or 150 feet.&nbsp; All that were erected for the purpose 
are commodious and comfortable, though the more recent structures are the 
best arranged.&nbsp; They are provided with every convenience for teaching,
and for the comfort of both teacher and pupil.&nbsp; Some of them cover two
city lots, while others occupy as many as six of these lots.&nbsp; Some 
will accommodate as many as 2000 pupils, and these large buildings have 
been found to be more economical than small ones.&nbsp; Each is provided 
with several fire-proof stairways, and each is in charge of a janitor, who 
resides in the building.&nbsp; The entrances for pupils are at the sides of
the building.&nbsp; Visitors enter through the large door in the 
centre.</p>
<p>The public schools are divided into Primary, Grammar, Evening, and 
Normal Schools.&nbsp; There are about 200 of these schools in the city, a 
Primary and a Grammar School often occupying the same building.&nbsp; Some 
of the Primaries are for boys or girls only, while in others both sexes are
admitted.&nbsp; The course in the Primaries is very simple, as very young 
children are taught here.&nbsp; The pupils are divided, according to 
qualification, into six grades.&nbsp; The lowest grade receives the 
simplest instruction, such as conversational lessons about common objects, 
or &ldquo;object teaching,&rdquo; which is designed to form habits of 
accurate observation; simple instruction in regard to morals and manners; 
reading and spelling easy words from the blackboard or chart; counting; and
simple addition by the aid of the numerical frame.&nbsp; From this simple, 
but substantial basis, the pupil is advanced as rapidly as his capabilities
will permit, from grade to grade; until the first, or highest, is 
reached.&nbsp; In this the instruction embraces the four ground rules of 
arithmetic, geography, writing, drawing on the slate, and advanced object 
lessons.&nbsp; When the pupil is proficient in these studies, he is 
transferred to the Grammar School.</p>
<p>The Grammar School takes up the course where it is dropped by the 
Primary, and gives to the pupil a sound and practical &ldquo;common school 
education.&rdquo;&nbsp; It embraces in its various grades, such studies as 
English grammar, history, astronomy <!-- page 669--><a 
name="page669"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 669</span>(in its simpler 
form), physical geography, composition, drawing, and book keeping, besides 
the simpler studies of the lower grades which were begun in the Primary 
School.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p669.jpg">
<img alt="THE FREE COLLEGE OF NEW YORK." src="images/p669.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Girls who are found proficient in the Grammar School course, are 
advanced to the Normal School, which is temporarily located at the corner 
of Broadway and Fourth street.&nbsp; Here they may enjoy the benefits of a 
course as thorough and extended as that afforded by the Free College.</p>
<p>Boys who have attended the Grammar Schools for a certain period, and are
found proficient in the course taught there, are promoted to the Free 
College of the city of New York.&nbsp; This noble institution is located at
the southeast corner of Lexington avenue and Twenty-third street.&nbsp; It 
is a handsome edifice of brick, stuccoed in imitation of brown stone, and 
was founded in 1848.&nbsp; The President is Horace Webster, LL.D., and the 
faculty includes some of the ablest men in the country.&nbsp; The course 
taught here is full and thorough, and is about the same as that of the best
colleges in the land.&nbsp; The entire expense of <!-- page 670--><a 
name="page670"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 670</span>the Female Normal 
School, and the Free College is borne by the city.</p>
<p>The whole public school system is free to all the children of the city, 
whose parents will avail themselves of it.&nbsp; Books, and everything 
needed, are furnished without charge.&nbsp; The pupil is put to no expense 
whatever, but is required to maintain habits of order and personal 
neatness.&nbsp; The cost to the city is gladly borne by the tax payers, for
it saves the metropolis from an increase of the great army of ignorant and 
idle men and women, which are the curse of all great cities.&nbsp; The very
poorest men or women can thus give to their children the priceless boon of 
knowledge, of which their youth was deprived.&nbsp; Profiting by the 
advantage thus acquired, these little ones, in after years, may rise to 
fame and fortune.&nbsp; Thus not only the metropolis but the whole country 
reaps the blessings of this magnificent system of free education.&nbsp; The
poor, however, are not the only persons who secure the advantages of the 
free schools for their children.&nbsp; Many wealthy, or moderately 
comfortable parents send their children to these schools, because they are 
the best in the city.</p>
<p>Connected with the day schools, there are twenty-seven evening schools, 
with an average annual attendance of 20,000 pupils.&nbsp; These are 
designed for the instruction of those whose avocations or age prevent them 
from attending the day schools.&nbsp; Only simple studies are taught in 
these schools.&nbsp; The pupils consist of cash boys, clerks, porters, and 
laboring men and women.&nbsp; Many of them are foreigners, who come to 
learn the English language.&nbsp; The adults show as much eagerness to 
learn as the younger pupils.&nbsp; All are generally neat in person, though
their clothing may be rough and worn.&nbsp; Sometime ago, a member of the 
Board of Education, in addressing one of these evening classes, dwelt 
especially upon the necessity of cultivating habits of personal 
neatness.&nbsp; It happened that there were several men present, whose 
appearance indicated that they had come directly from their work to the 
school.&nbsp; One of them arose, and offered the following excuse for their
appearance.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t always come to school in 
this way, but we were at work in the <!-- page 671--><a 
name="page671"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 671</span>yard pretty late, and
had no time to go home for supper even, as we didn&rsquo;t want to be late 
at school; and not expecting any visitors, we made up our minds to come as 
we were.&nbsp; The Principal knows us, and we knew he would excuse us for 
coming so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An Evening High School, for males only, has been established, at which 
working men, and others unable to attend the day schools, may pursue a more
extended course of study.&nbsp; English grammar, mathematics, natural 
science, drawing, navigation, municipal and constitutional law, 
phonography, declamation, book-keeping, Latin, French, German, and Spanish 
are embraced in the course.&nbsp; The students may pursue one or more 
studies, as they may desire.</p>
<p>The Mission Schools have been mentioned already.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; THE COLLEGES.</h3>
<p>The higher institutions of learning are numerous, but we can mention 
only the principal here.</p>
<p>The University of the City of New York was established in 1831, and is 
regarded as one of the best institutions of its kind in the country.&nbsp; 
It has a chancellor and a full corps of professors in its several 
schools.&nbsp; It includes a preparatory department, a grammar school, a 
school of art, a school of civil engineering, a school of analytical and 
practical chemistry, a school of medicine, and a school of law.&nbsp; The 
medical school has been especially famous, and has numbered among its 
professors, at various times, such men as Valentine Mott, John W. Draper, 
and William H. Van Buren.</p>
<p>The University building is a showy edifice of white marble, in the 
English collegiate style of architecture, and is situated on the east side 
of Washington Square, between Waverley and East Washington Places, fronting
on University Place.&nbsp; It has a frontage of 200 feet and a depth of 100
feet.&nbsp; The principal entrance is by the central door.&nbsp; From this 
a flight of marble <!-- page 672--><a name="page672"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 672</span>steps leads to the main floor.&nbsp; Besides 
the rooms used for the various purposes of the University, there is a 
handsome chapel, and a hall containing a valuable library.&nbsp; Many of 
the rooms of the building are occupied by physicians, artists, and various 
societies, and as chambers by single men.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p672.jpg">
<img alt="UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK." src="images/p672.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Columbia College, occupying the block bounded by Madison and Fourth 
avenues, and Forty-ninth and Fiftieth streets, is the oldest institution of
learning in the State, and ranks among the leading institutions of the 
country.&nbsp; It was founded by George II., in 1754, under the title of 
King&rsquo;s College.&nbsp; The college was originally located in the lower
part of the city, but, in 1849, the trustees purchased the present 
buildings, which were formerly used by the State Institution for Deaf 
Mutes.&nbsp; Attached to the college is a school of mines, in which full 
instruction is given in all the branches required to make a perfect 
scientific as well as a practical mining engineer.&nbsp; Large and 
extensive laboratories are attached to the school.&nbsp; There is also a 
law school, which forms a portion of the college, and which is located in 
Lafayette Place, opposite the Astor Library.&nbsp; The College of 
Physicians and Surgeons, at the corner of Twenty-third street <!-- page 
673--><a name="page673"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 673</span>and Fourth 
avenue, constitutes the medical school of Columbia College.&nbsp; The 
college is very wealthy, and its property is valued at several millions of 
dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p673.jpg">
<img alt="COLUMBIA COLLEGE." src="images/p673.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The other colleges are, the College of St. Francis Xavier, in West 
Fifteenth street, the Union Theological Seminary, conducted by the 
Presbyterian Church, the College of Pharmacy, the New York Medical College 
for Women, the New York College of Veterinary Surgeons, the General 
Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church, the Rutgers Female
College, the New York Hom&oelig;opathic College, several other medical 
colleges, and several business colleges.</p>
<p>There are about 325 private and sectarian schools and academies in New 
York, with an average annual attendance of about 15,000 or 20,000 pupils, 
and employing more than 1500 teachers.</p>
<p>The Cooper Institute is an imposing edifice of brown stone, occupying 
the block bounded by Third and Fourth avenues, and Seventh and Eighth 
streets.&nbsp; It was erected at a cost of nearly half a million dollars, 
by Peter Cooper, Esq., an <!-- page 674--><a name="page674"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 674</span>eminent merchant of New York.&nbsp; The 
basement is occupied by an immense lecture room, capable of seating several
thousand persons.&nbsp; The street floor is taken up with stores.&nbsp; The
floor above this contains a number of offices, and the remainder of the 
building is occupied by a free library and reading room, and halls for 
lectures and for study.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p674.jpg">
<img alt="THE COOPER INSTITUTE." src="images/p674.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Institute is designed for the gratuitous instruction of the working 
classes in science, art, telegraphy, English, literature, and the foreign 
languages.&nbsp; One of its departments is a School of Design for 
women.&nbsp; The course is thorough and the standard of proficiency is 
high.&nbsp; The examinations are very searching, and it may be safely 
asserted, that the graduates of this institution are thoroughly grounded in
the practical arts and sciences.&nbsp; The institution is a noble monument 
to the wisdom and benevolence of its founder, and is doing an immense 
amount of good to the class he designed to benefit.&nbsp; It is liberally 
endowed, and is managed by a Board of Directors.&nbsp; The stores and 
offices yield an annual income of nearly $30,000.&nbsp; The annual 
attendance upon the schools is about 1800.</p>
<h2><!-- page 675--><a name="page675"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
675</span>LVII.&nbsp; JEROME PARK.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The opening of the Central Park saved horseflesh in New 
York,&rdquo; said an old jockey.&nbsp; Few who know the truth will gainsay 
this assertion.&nbsp; The opening of Jerome Park did as much for 
&ldquo;horseflesh&rdquo; by rescuing the sport of horse racing from the 
blackguards and thieves, into whose hands it had fallen, and placing it 
upon a respectable footing.</p>
<p>The Jerome Park Race Course owes its existence to Mr. Leonard W. Jerome,
after whom it was named.&nbsp; The way in which it came into existence at 
all, was as follows: &ldquo;The trains of the New York and New Haven 
Railroad enter the Metropolis upon the Harlem track.&nbsp; Justified by 
highly satisfactory reasons, the management of the Company decided to 
secure a different means of ingress to the city, and a tacit agreement was 
made with Leonard W. Jerome to the effect that if he would secure the right
of way from the proper terminus of the New Haven Road clear through to New 
York, they would change their route.&nbsp; The firm at once bought all the 
land they could find along a strip of nine miles through Westchester 
County, up what is known as the Saw-Mill River Valley.&nbsp; Some portion 
of their purchase cost them at the rate of $300 an acre.&nbsp; Meanwhile 
Commodore Vanderbilt got news of the movement, bought largely of the New 
Haven stock, and at the succeeding election of directors was able to make 
such changes in the board as effectually stopped the change of base from 
the Harlem Line.&nbsp; The contract on which Jerome had acted was not in 
such a form as admitted of litigation.&nbsp; He had acquired an immense 
amount of real estate with no prospect of immediate realizations.&nbsp; 
Then came the idea of the race-course.&nbsp; Not less <!-- page 676--><a 
name="page676"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 676</span>than $100,000 was 
cleared as net profit from that expedient.&nbsp; Another portion of the 
land was sold as a cemetery.&nbsp; But Jerome has the greater part of the 
property still on his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The race-course is the property of the American Jockey Club, and the 
Spring and Fall Meetings of that association are held there, and are 
attended by large and fashionable crowds.&nbsp; The Club House and Club 
Stand occupy the most retired and elevated portion of the grounds, but the 
best point of view is the Grand Stand, in front of which is the usual 
starting point and winning post.&nbsp; The price of admission is high, but 
the grounds are thronged with vehicles and persons on foot.&nbsp; As many 
as ten or fifteen thousand persons may be seen within the enclosure, while 
the favorable positions outside of the grounds are black with more 
economical spectators.&nbsp; The crowd is orderly and good-humored, and the
occasion is rarely marred by any act of rowdyism or lawlessness.</p>
<p>A great deal of money changes hands at the races.&nbsp; Bets are freely 
offered and taken on the various horses.&nbsp; The pools sell rapidly, and 
the genial auctioneer finds his post no sinecure.&nbsp; The struggles of 
the noble animals are watched with the deepest interest.&nbsp; The greatest
excitement prevails amongst the <i>&eacute;lite</i> in the private stands, 
as well as throughout the common herd below.&nbsp; Every eye is strained to
watch the swift coursers as they whirl down the track, and when the quarter
stretch is gained the excitement is beyond control.&nbsp; The victor steed 
flashes with lightning speed by the winning post amidst a storm of cheers 
and yells of delight.</p>
<p>The course is still new, but the system which it has inaugurated is 
becoming more thorough every year.&nbsp; The management is in the hands of 
gentlemen of character, who are seeking to make at least one place in the 
country where the blackguards and reckless gamblers who disgrace the 
American turf shall be powerless to control affairs.&nbsp; The benefits of 
this management will be very great.&nbsp; The stock of the State will be 
vastly improved, and the metropolis, especially, will be able to boast some
of the finest blooded racers in the world.</p>
<h2><!-- page 677--><a name="page677"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
677</span>LVIII.&nbsp; COMMODORE VANDERBILT.</h2>
<p>Visitors to the Central Park on pleasant afternoons, rarely fail to 
notice a light buggy, generally with a single occupant, drawn by a pair of 
fine horses, whose whole appearance is indicative of their high breeding 
and great speed.&nbsp; The animals would command attention anywhere, and 
the driver would excite equal notice, for all are physically among the 
finest specimens of their kind to be met with in the country.&nbsp; The man
is almost seventy-eight years of age, but he looks twenty years 
younger.&nbsp; He is large of frame, tall, erect, and with a face as 
handsome and as cold as a statue.&nbsp; He is one of the best known men in 
the country, and he is called Cornelius Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>He was born on Staten Island, May 27th, 1794.&nbsp; His father was a 
boatman, who had acquired money enough by attention to his business to 
purchase and stock a farm, on which the subject of this sketch passed his 
boyhood.&nbsp; Many interesting stories are told of Vanderbilt&rsquo;s 
boyhood, showing an early development of the vigorous traits which have 
marked his maturer life.&nbsp; His passion for horses seems to have been 
born with him.&nbsp; In his seventeenth year he became a boatman in New 
York harbor, devoting himself to the task of rowing passengers about or 
across the harbor in his own boat.&nbsp; He displayed great energy and 
determination, and not a little genius, in this calling, and earned money 
rapidly and steadily.&nbsp; At the age of nineteen he married.&nbsp; In 
1815, having saved money enough, he built a fine schooner, and in the 
winter embarked in the coasting trade, going as far south as Charleston, 
S.C., but continuing to ply his boat in the harbor during the summer.&nbsp;
By the time he was <!-- page 678--><a name="page678"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 678</span>twenty-four years old, he had saved nine 
thousand dollars, and had built several small vessels.</p>
<p>In 1818, he suddenly abandoned his flourishing business, and accepted 
the command of a steamboat, with a salary of one thousand dollars.&nbsp; 
His friends were greatly astonished at this step, and remonstrated with him
warmly, but without shaking his resolution.&nbsp; He had the sagacity to 
perceive that the steamboats were about to revolutionize the whole system 
of water transportation, and he meant to secure a foothold in the new order
of affairs without delay.&nbsp; The result vindicated his wisdom.</p>
<p>The steamer which he commanded was one of a line plying between New York
and New Brunswick&mdash;the old route to Philadelphia.&nbsp; This line was 
conducted by Mr. Thomas Gibbons, and was warmly opposed by the 
representatives of Fulton and Livingston, who claimed a monopoly of the 
right to navigate the waters of New York by steam.&nbsp; Gibbons was 
effectively supported by Vanderbilt, who ran his boat regularly in spite of
all efforts made to stop him, until the courts sustained him in his 
rights.&nbsp; Then Vanderbilt was allowed to control the line in his own 
way, and conducted it with such success that it paid Gibbons an annual 
profit of forty thousand dollars.</p>
<p>In 1829, at the age of thirty-five, he left the service of Mr. Gibbons, 
and for the second time began life on his own account.&nbsp; He built a 
small steamer, called the &ldquo;Caroline,&rdquo; and commanded her 
himself.&nbsp; In a few years he was the owner of several small steamers 
plying between New York and the neighboring towns.&nbsp; Thus began his 
remarkable career as a steamboat owner, which was one unbroken round of 
prosperity.&nbsp; He eventually became the most important man in the 
steamboat interest of the country.&nbsp; He has owned or has had an 
interest in one hundred steam vessels&mdash;hence his title of 
Commodore&mdash;and has been instrumental in a greater degree than any 
other man, in bringing down the tariff of steamboat fares.&nbsp; He has 
never lost a vessel by fire, by explosion, or a wreck.&nbsp; His 
&ldquo;North Star&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vanderbilt&rdquo; were famous 
steamships in their day, and in the latter he made an extended tour to the 
various ports of Europe.</p>

<p>A year or two before the Civil War, Mr. Vanderbilt began to invest 
largely in railroad stocks and iron works.&nbsp; He at length secured the 
control of the Hudson River, Harlem and New York Central Roads, and their 
dependencies, which made him as important a personage in this branch of our
industry as he had been in the steamboat interest.&nbsp; His control of 
these roads also gave him a commanding influence in the stock market of 
Wall street, and brought within his reach numerous opportunities for 
enriching himself by speculations, of which he was not slow to avail 
himself.&nbsp; Wall street is full of stories concerning him, and it is 
evident from many of these that he has dealt the dealers there too many 
hard blows to be popular amongst them.</p>
<p>Mr. Vanderbilt resides in a handsome old-fashioned brick mansion in East
Washington Place.&nbsp; His business office is in Fourth street, near 
Broadway.&nbsp; His wealth is very great, and is generally estimated in the
city at over forty millions of dollars.&nbsp; He is said to have a greater 
command of large sums of ready money than almost any other American 
capitalist.</p>
<p>Mr. Vanderbilt has been twice married, and is the father of thirteen 
children&mdash;nine daughters and four sons, all the children of his first 
wife.&nbsp; His grandchildren are numerous.</p>

680</span>LIX.&nbsp; THE BUMMERS.</h2>
<p>The Bummer is simply one who detests work, and who manages to live in 
some degree of comfort without earning the means of doing so.&nbsp; There 
are many such in the city.&nbsp; The genuine Bummer is more of a beggar 
than a thief, though he will steal if he has an opportunity.&nbsp; Nothing 
will induce him to go to work, not even the prospect of starvation.&nbsp; 
He has a sublime confidence in his ability to get through life easily and 
lazily, and his greatest horror is the probability of falling into the 
hands of the police, and being sent to Blackwell&rsquo;s Island as a 
vagrant.&nbsp; All that he desires is money enough to gratify a few actual 
wants, food enough to eat, clothing to cover his nakedness, and a place 
where he can enjoy the warmth of a fire in the winter.&nbsp; He has great 
faith in the charitableness of New York, and thinks that any of the 
necessities of life may be had here for the asking, and he does not 
hesitate to ask for them.&nbsp; You would wound him deeply by calling him a
beggar.&nbsp; He never begs, he only asks.&nbsp; He asks bread of the 
baker, or from the housekeepers of the city, and obtains his clothing in 
the same way.&nbsp; If he wants a little pocket money, he does not hesitate
to ask for it from the passers-by on the streets.&nbsp; He never spends 
money on food.&nbsp; Such a use of &ldquo;the needful&rdquo; is a deadly 
sin in his eyes.&nbsp; Money was made to furnish him with cheap whiskey and
bad tobacco.&nbsp; It is too easy to obtain food by asking for it to think 
of buying it.&nbsp; If he does not receive enough to satisfy his hunger at 
one house, he goes to another, and repeats his efforts until he is 
satisfied.&nbsp; One hates to refuse food to any human being who claims to 
have need of it, and the Bummer knows this.&nbsp; Some of these people keep
lists of various <!-- page 681--><a name="page681"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 681</span>householders, with a memorandum attached to 
each name, showing the best hours for calling, and the nature of the 
articles that will probably be given.&nbsp; They assist each other by 
information as to the charitably disposed, and should any householder 
display any degree of liberality toward them, he is sure to be overrun by a
host of seedy and hungry Bummers.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the City Hall Park, which was then shaded by noble old 
trees, and the Battery, were the favorite resorts of this class in fair 
weather.&nbsp; They would sit on the benches of the park, and doze, or, 
when very sleepy, would lie at full length upon them, until aroused by a 
blow from a policeman&rsquo;s club upon the soles of their shoes.&nbsp; 
They were not allowed to sleep in the park, and when caught in the act were
compelled to join the throng of promenaders in Broadway, and &ldquo;move 
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the Battery they were rarely disturbed.&nbsp; That 
locality was then a mere receptacle for trash, and the Bummer was at home 
there.&nbsp; The dirt heaps were softer than the stones, and the breeze 
that came in from the bay was highly favorable to slumber.&nbsp; Now, all 
has been changed.&nbsp; The massive edifice of the New Post-office covers 
the old resort of the Bummer, and the Battery has been made so spruce and 
trim that it needs not the gruff voice of the gray-coated guardian of the 
place to make the Bummer feel that it is lost to him forever.</p>
<p>During the day, the Bummer roams about the city, resting where he can, 
and occasionally dropping into a bar-room to fill himself with five-cent 
whiskey.&nbsp; He is not averse to receiving a treat, and it should be 
mentioned to his credit that he is always ready to treat his friends to his
favorite drink when he is in funds.&nbsp; When hungry, he 
&ldquo;asks&rdquo; for food.&nbsp; He is fond of visiting the second-rate 
theatres at the expense of somebody else, and hangs around them, hoping 
some one will give him a check before the performance is over.&nbsp; In 
mild weather, he will sleep almost anywhere, in or around a market house, 
or in an empty wagon.&nbsp; The hay-barges in North River afford 
comfortable beds, and many Bummers occupy them.&nbsp; In wet or cold 
weather, the Bummer patronizes the cheap lodging-houses, or the cellars, 
and as a last resort applies for shelter at the station <!-- page 682--><a 
name="page682"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 682</span>house.&nbsp; He is 
diffident about asking assistance at the last place, however, for he has a 
vague idea that the police would be only too glad to get him safely lodged 
on the Island.&nbsp; One of his favorite amusements is attendance upon the 
police courts.&nbsp; This affords him a few hours of rest in a comfortable 
place, and furnishes him with material for thought.</p>
<p>In begging, the Bummer never asks boldly for aid.&nbsp; He always 
prefaces his request with a pitiful story of misfortune, and expresses his 
sense of shame at being an able-bodied man and yet compelled to 
&ldquo;ask&rdquo; for assistance.&nbsp; He is an adept at deceiving 
good-hearted people, and very clever at assuming the air of innocent 
misfortune.&nbsp; Thus he supplies his wants.</p>
<p>In his confidential moments, he readily admits that 
&ldquo;Bumming&rdquo; is a hard life, but he is confident that it is better
than working for a living.&nbsp; You cannot induce him to accept any 
species of employment, however light.&nbsp; Vagrancy has a strange 
fascination for him, and he will be nothing but what he is until five-cent 
whiskey sinks him to a grade still lower.&nbsp; Sometimes he sees his doom 
afar off, and anticipates it by seeking the cold waters of the East 
River.&nbsp; At the best, suicide is the happiest end he can hope for, and 
it does not require much exertion to drown oneself.&nbsp; Should he allow 
events to take their natural course, there is but one prospect before 
him&mdash;a pauper&rsquo;s death and the dissecting-table.</p>
<p>Some of these men have had fair starts in life.&nbsp; Some of them are 
well educated, and could have risen to eminence in some useful 
calling.&nbsp; A fondness for liquor and a disinclination to work have been
their ruin.</p>
<h2><!-- page 683--><a name="page683"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
683</span>LX.&nbsp; TENEMENT HOUSE LIFE.</h2>
<p>The peculiar formation of the island of Manhattan renders it impossible 
for the city to expand save in one direction.&nbsp; On the south, east, and
west its growth is checked by the waters of the rivers and bay, so that it 
can increase only to the northward.&nbsp; The lower part of the island is 
being occupied for business purposes more and more exclusively every year, 
and the people are being forced higher up town.&nbsp; Those who remain in 
the extreme lower portion for purposes of residence are simply the very 
poor.&nbsp; Those who can afford to do so, seek locations removed as far as
is convenient to them from the business section.&nbsp; The laboring class, 
by which I mean all who are forced to pursue some regular occupation for 
their support, are not able to go far from their work, and are obliged to 
remain in locations which will enable them to reach their places of 
business with as little delay as possible.</p>
<p>Consequently the bulk of the population is packed into that portion of 
the city which lies between the City Hall and Fourteenth street.&nbsp; By 
the United States Census of 1870, the population of the wards in this 
district was reported as follows:</p>

684</span>By the same census, the total population of the city in 1870 was 
942,292.&nbsp; The district included in the above wards is about two miles 
square, which would give for this portion of New York an average population
of 238,902 to the mile square.&nbsp; The Seventeenth ward covers less than 
one-fortieth of the whole area of the island, and contains more than 
one-tenth of the whole population.</p>
<p>The total area of the city is twenty-two square miles, and we find that 
one-half of its population is cramped within an area of about four square 
miles.&nbsp; It is evident, therefore, that they must be housed in a very 
small number of buildings, and such indeed is the case.</p>
<p>The section of the city embraced in the wards we have named is filled 
with a class of buildings called tenement houses.&nbsp; The law classes all
dwellings containing three or more families as tenement houses, but the 
true tenement house is an institution peculiar to New York.&nbsp; There are
about 70,000 buildings in the city used for purposes of business and as 
dwellings, and of these, 20,000 are tenement houses, containing about 
160,000 families, or about 500,000 people.&nbsp; This would give an average
population of eight families or twenty persons to each tenement house in 
the city.&nbsp; In 1867 the number of tenement houses was 18,582.&nbsp; The

685</span>The reader will no doubt suppose that the inmates of these houses
are compelled to remain in them because of extreme poverty.&nbsp; This is 
not the case.&nbsp; The tenement houses are occupied mainly by the honest 
laboring population of New York, who receive fair wages for their 
work.&nbsp; They herd here because the rents of single houses are either 
out of proportion to, or beyond their means, and because they are 
convenient to their work.&nbsp; They are not paupers, but they cannot 
afford the fearful cost of a separate home, and they are forced to resort 
to this mode of life in order to live with any degree of comfort.&nbsp; 
Many of the most skilled mechanics, many of the best paid operatives of 
both sexes, who are earning comfortable wages, are forced to live in these 
vast barracks, simply because the bare rent of an empty house in a 
moderately decent neighborhood, is from $1000 upward.&nbsp; Did the city 
possess some means of rapid transit between its upper and lower 
extremities, which would prevent the loss of the time now wasted in 
traversing the length of the island, there can be no doubt that the 
tenement sections would soon be thinned out.</p>
<p>There are two classes of tenement houses in the city.&nbsp; Those 
occupied by the well-to-do working people, and those which are simply the 
homes of the poor.&nbsp; The first are immense, but spruce looking 
structures, and are kept cleaner than the latter, but all suffer from the 
evils incident to and inseparable from such close packing.&nbsp; Those of 
the second class are simply dens of vice and misery.&nbsp; In the older 
quarters of the city, many of the old time residences are now occupied as 
tenement houses.&nbsp; The old Walton mansion in Pearl street, opposite the
vast establishment of Harper &amp; Brothers, was once the most elegant and 
hospitable mansion in New York.&nbsp; It is now one of the most wretched 
tenement houses in the city.&nbsp; The tenement houses of the upper wards, 
however, were constructed for the uses to which they are put.&nbsp; As 
pecuniary investments they pay well, the rents sometimes yielding as much 
as thirty per cent. on the investment.&nbsp; One of them shall serve as a 
description of the average tenement house.&nbsp; The building stands on a 
lot with a front of 50 feet, and a depth of 250 feet.&nbsp; It has an alley
running the whole depth <!-- page 686--><a name="page686"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 686</span>on each side of it.&nbsp; These alley-ways are
excavated to the depth of the cellars, arched over, and covered with flag 
stones, in which, at intervals, are open gratings to give light below; the 
whole length of which space is occupied by water closets, without doors, 
and under which are open drains communicating with the street sewers.&nbsp;
The building is five stories high, and has a flat roof.&nbsp; The only 
ventilation is by a window, which opens against a dead wall eight feet 
distant, and to which rises the vapor from the vault below.&nbsp; There is 
water on each floor, and gas pipes are laid through the building, so that 
those who desire it can use gas.&nbsp; The building contains 126 families, 
or about 700 inhabitants.&nbsp; Each family has a narrow sitting-room, 
which is used also for working and eating, and a closet called a bed 
room.&nbsp; But few of the rooms are properly ventilated.&nbsp; The sun 
never shines in at the windows, and if the sky is overcast the rooms are so
dark as to need artificial light.&nbsp; The whole house is dirty, and is 
filled with the mingled odors from the cooking-stoves and the sinks.&nbsp; 
In the winter the rooms are kept too close by the stoves, and in the summer
the natural heat is made tenfold greater by the fires for cooking and 
washing.&nbsp; Pass these houses on a hot night, and you will see the 
streets in front of them filled with the occupants, and every window choked
up with human heads, all panting and praying for relief and fresh 
air.&nbsp; Sometimes the families living in the close rooms we have 
described, take &ldquo;boarders,&rdquo; who pay a part of the expenses of 
the &ldquo;establishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Formerly the occupants of these 
buildings emptied their filth and refuse matter into the public streets, 
which in these quarters were simply horrible to behold; but of late years, 
the police, by compelling a rigid observance of the sanitary laws, have 
greatly improved the condition of the houses and streets, and consequently 
the health of the people.&nbsp; During the past winter, however, many of 
the East side streets have become horribly filthy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p688.jpg">
<img alt="THE INSIDE VIEW OF A TENEMENT HOUSE." src="images/p688.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The reader must not suppose that the house just described is an 
exceptional establishment.&nbsp; In the Eleventh and Seventeenth wards 
whole streets, for many blocks, are lined with similar houses.&nbsp; There 
are many single blocks of dwellings containing <!-- page 689--><a 
name="page689"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 689</span>twice the number of 
families residing on Fifth avenue, on both sides of that street, from 
Washington Square to the Park, or than a continuous row of dwellings 
similar to those on Fifth avenue, three or four miles in length.&nbsp; The 
Fourth ward, covering an area of 83 acres, contains 23,748 
inhabitants.&nbsp; The city of Springfield (Massachusetts), contains 26,703
inhabitants.&nbsp; The Eleventh ward, comprising 196 acres, contains more 
people than the cities of Mobile (Alabama), and Salem (Massachusetts), 
combined.&nbsp; The Seventh ward, covering 110 acres, contains more 
inhabitants than the city of Syracuse (New York).&nbsp; The Seventeenth 
ward, covering 331 acres, contains more inhabitants than the city of 
Cleveland (Ohio), which is the fifteenth city in the Union in respect of 
population.</p>
<p>The best of the tenement houses are uncomfortable.&nbsp; Where so large 
a number of people are gathered under the same roof to live as they please,
it is impossible to keep the premises clean.&nbsp; A very large portion of 
them are in bad repair and in equally bad sanitary condition.&nbsp; In 1867
these houses made up fifty-two per cent. of the whole number, and there is 
no reason to believe that there has been any improvement since then.&nbsp; 
Many of them are simply appalling.&nbsp; They become more wretched and 
squalid as the East River and Five Points sections are reached.&nbsp; 
Cherry, Water, and the neighboring streets, are little better than charnel 
houses.</p>
<p>About three months ago one of the most wretched rookeries in the city 
was cleared out and cleansed by order of the Board of Health.&nbsp; This 
was known as &ldquo;Sweeney&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and stood in Gotham 
Court.&nbsp; The immediate cause of its overhauling was the discovery of 
its actual condition made by Detective Finn and Mr. Edward Crapsey of the 
New York <i>Times</i>, during a visit to it.&nbsp; Mr. Crapsey gives the 
following interesting account of his visit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we stopped in Cherry street at the entrance to Gotham Court, 
and Detective Finn dug a tunnel of light with his bullseye lantern into the
foulness and blackness of that smirch on civilization, a score or more of 
boys who had been congregated at the edge of the court suddenly plunged 
back into the <!-- page 690--><a name="page690"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 690</span>obscurity, and we heard the splash of their 
feet in the foul collections of the pavements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This bullseye is an old acquaintance here,&rsquo; said the
detective, &lsquo;and as its coming most always means &ldquo;somebody 
wanted,&rdquo; you see how they hide.&nbsp; Though why they should object 
to go to jail is more than I know; I&rsquo;d rather stay in the worst 
dungeon in town than here.&nbsp; Come this way and I&rsquo;ll show you 
why.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carefully keeping in the little track of light cut into the 
darkness by the lantern, I followed the speaker, who turned into the first 
door on the right, and I found myself in an entry about four feet by six, 
with steep, rough, rickety stairs leading upward in the foreground, and 
their counterparts at the rear giving access to as successful a manufactory
of disease and death as any city on earth can show.&nbsp; Coming to the 
first of these stairs, I was peremptorily halted by the foul stenches 
rising from below; but Finn, who had reached the bottom, threw back the 
relentless light upon the descending way and urged me on.&nbsp; Every step 
oozed with moisture and was covered sole deep with unmentionable filth; but
I ventured on, and reaching my conductor, stood in a vault some twelve feet
wide and two hundred long, which extended under the whole of West Gotham 
Court.&nbsp; The walls of rough stone dripped with slimy exudations, while 
the pavements yielded to the slightest pressure of the feet a suffocating 
odor compounded of bilge-water and sulphuretted hydrogen.&nbsp; Upon one 
side of this elongated cave of horrors were ranged a hundred closets, every
one of which reeked with this filth, mixed with that slimy moisture which 
was everywhere as a proof that the waters of the neighboring East River 
penetrated, and lingered here to foul instead of purify.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think of this?&rsquo; said Finn, throwing the 
light of his lantern hither and thither so that every horror might be 
dragged from the darkness that all seemed to covet.&nbsp; &lsquo;All the 
thousands living in the barracks must come here, and just think of all the 
young ones above that never did any harm having to take in this 
stuff;&rsquo; and the detective struck out spitefully at the noxious 
air.&nbsp; As he did so, the gurgling <!-- page 691--><a 
name="page691"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 691</span>of water at the 
Cherry street end of the vault caught his ear, and penetrating thither, he 
peered curiously about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I say, Tom,&rsquo; he called back to his companion, who 
had remained with me in the darkness, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a big break in 
the Croton main.&rsquo;&nbsp; But a moment later, in an affrighted voice: 
&lsquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Its the sewer!&nbsp; I never knew of this 
opening into it before.&nbsp; Paugh! how it smells.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s 
nothing up where you are.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bet on the undertaker having 
more jobs in the house than ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time I began to feel sick and faint in that tainted air, 
and would have rushed up the stairs if I could have seen them.&nbsp; But 
Finn was exploring that sewer horror with his lantern.&nbsp; As I came down
I had seen a pool of stagnant, green-coated water somewhere near the foot 
of the stairs, and, being afraid to stir in the thick darkness, was forced 
to call my guide, and, frankly state the urgent necessity for an immediate 
return above.&nbsp; The matter-of-fact policeman came up, and cast the 
liberating light upon the stairs, but rebuked me as I eagerly took in the 
comparatively purer atmosphere from above.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t 
stand it five minutes; how do you suppose they do, year in and year 
out?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Even they don&rsquo;t stand it many years, I 
should think,&rsquo; was my involuntary reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we stepped out into the court again, the glare of the bullseye
dragged a strange face out of the darkness.&nbsp; It was that of a youth of
eighteen or twenty years, ruddy, puffed, with the corners of the mouth 
grotesquely twisted.&nbsp; The detective greeted the person owning this 
face with the fervor of old acquaintanceship: &lsquo;Eh, Buster!&nbsp; 
What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hello, Jimmy Finn!&nbsp; What yez 
doin&rsquo; here?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Never mind, Buster.&nbsp; 
What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, Jimmy, didn&rsquo;t yez know I 
lodges here now?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Where?&nbsp;
Who with?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Beyant, wid the Pensioner.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Go on.&nbsp; Show me where you lodge.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sure, 
Jimmy, it isn&rsquo;t me as would lie to yez.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had expressed a desire to penetrate into some of these 
kennels for crushed humanity; and Finn, with the happy acumen of his tribe,
seizing the first plausible pretext, was relentless, and insisted on 
doubting the word of the Buster.&nbsp; <!-- page 692--><a 
name="page692"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 692</span>That unfortunate with
the puffy face, who seemed to know his man too well to protract resistance,
puffed ahead of us up the black, oozy court, with myriads of windows made 
ghastly by the pale flicker of kerosene lamps in tiers above us, until he 
came to the last door but one upon the left side of the court, over which 
the letter S was sprawled upon the coping stone.&nbsp; The bullseye had 
been darkened, and when the Buster plunged through the doorway he was lost 
to sight in the impenetrable darkness beyond.&nbsp; We heard him though, 
stumbling against stairs that creaked dismally, and the slide being drawn 
back, the friendly light made clear the way for him and us.&nbsp; There was
an entry precisely like the one we had entered before, with a flight of 
narrow, almost perpendicular stairs, with so sharp a twist in them that we 
could see only half up.&nbsp; The banisters in sight had precisely three 
uprights, and looked as if the whole thing would crumble at a touch; while 
the stairs were so smooth and thin with the treading of innumerable feet 
that they almost refused a foothold.&nbsp; Following the Buster, who 
grappled with the steep and dangerous ascent with the daring born of habit,
I somehow got up stairs, wondering how any one ever got down in the dark 
without breaking his neck.&nbsp; Thinking it possible there might be a 
light sometimes to guide the pauper hosts from their hazardous heights to 
the stability of the street, I inquired as to the fact, only to meet the 
contempt of the Buster for the gross ignorance that could dictate such a 
question.&nbsp; &lsquo;A light for the stairs!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;d give 
it?&nbsp; Sweeney?&nbsp; Not much!&nbsp; Or the tenants?&nbsp; 
Skasely!&nbsp; Them&rsquo;s too poor!&rsquo;&nbsp; While he muttered, the 
Buster had pawed his way up stairs with surprising agility, until he 
reached a door on the third landing.&nbsp; Turning triumphantly to the 
detective, he announced: &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s where I lodges, Jimmy!&nbsp; 
You knows I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to yez.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see whether you would or no,&rsquo; said Finn,
tapping on the door.&nbsp; Being told to come in, he opened it; and on this
trivial but dexterous pretext we invaded the sanctity of a home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No tale is so good as one plainly told, and I tell precisely <!--
page 693--><a name="page693"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 693</span>what I 
saw.&nbsp; This home was composed, in the parlance of the place, of a 
&lsquo;room and bedroom.&rsquo;&nbsp; The room was about twelve feet 
square, and eight feet from floor to ceiling.&nbsp; It had two windows 
opening upon the court, and a large fireplace filled with a cooking 
stove.&nbsp; In the way of additional furniture, it had a common deal 
table, three broken wooden chairs, a few dishes and cooking utensils, and 
two &lsquo;shakedowns,&rsquo; as the piles of straw stuffed into bed-ticks 
are called; but it had nothing whatever beyond these articles.&nbsp; There 
was not even the remnant of a bedstead; not a cheap print, so common in the
hovels of the poor, to relieve the blankness of the rough, whitewashed 
walls.&nbsp; The bedroom, which was little more than half the size of the 
other, was that outrage of capital upon poverty known as a &lsquo;dark 
room,&rsquo; by which is meant that it had no window opening to the outer 
air; and this closet had no furniture whatever except two 
&lsquo;shakedowns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the contracted space of these two rooms, and supplied with 
these scanty appliances for comfort, nine human beings were stowed.&nbsp; 
First there was the &lsquo;Pensioner,&rsquo; a man of about thirty-five 
years, next his wife, then their three children, a woman lodger with two 
children, and the &lsquo;Buster,&rsquo; the latter paying fifteen cents per
night for his shelter; but I did not learn the amount paid by the woman for
the accommodation of herself and children.&nbsp; The Buster, having been 
indignant at my inquiry as to the light upon the stairs, was now made merry
by Finn supposing he had a regular bed and bedstead for the money.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Indade, he has not, but a &ldquo;shakedown&rdquo; like the rest of 
us,&rsquo; said the woman; but the Buster rebuked this assumption of an 
impossible prosperity by promptly exclaiming, &lsquo;Whist! ye knows I 
stretch on the boords without any shakedown whatsumdever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finn was of opinion the bed was hard but healthy, and fixing his 
eyes on the Buster&rsquo;s flabby face thought it possible he had any 
desirable number of &lsquo;square meals&rsquo; per day; but that individual
limited his acquirements in that way for the day then closed to four.&nbsp;
Finn then touching on the number of drinks, the Buster, being driven into 
conjecture and a corner <!-- page 694--><a name="page694"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 694</span>by the problem, was thrust out of the 
foreground of our investigations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By various wily tricks of his trade, Detective Finn managed to 
get a deal of information out of the Pensioner without seeming to be either
inquisitive or intrusive, or even without rubbing the coat of his poverty 
the wrong way.&nbsp; From this source I learned that five dollars per month
was paid as rent for these two third-floor rooms, and that everybody 
concerned deemed them dirt cheap at the price.&nbsp; Light was obtained 
from kerosene lamps at the expense of the tenant, and water had to be 
carried from the court below, while all refuse matter not emptied into the 
court itself, had to be taken to the foul vaults beneath it.&nbsp; The 
rooms, having all these drawbacks, and being destitute of the commonest 
appliances for comfort or decency, did not appear to be in the highest 
degree eligible; yet the Pensioner considered himself fortunate in having 
secured them.&nbsp; His experience in living must have been very doleful, 
for he declared that he had seen worse places.&nbsp; In itself, and so far 
as the landlord was concerned, I doubted him; but I had myself seen fouler 
places than these two rooms, which had been made so by the tenants.&nbsp; 
All that cleanliness could do to make the kennel of the Pensioner habitable
had been done, and I looked with more respect upon the uncouth woman who 
had scoured the rough floor white, than I ever had upon a gaudily attired 
dame sweeping Broadway with her silken trail.&nbsp; The thrift that had so 
little for its nourishment had not been expended wholly upon the floor, for
I noticed that the two children asleep on the shakedown were clean, while 
the little fellow four years of age, who was apparently prepared for bed as
he was entirely naked, but sat as yet upon one of the three chairs, had no 
speck of dirt upon his fair white skin.&nbsp; A painter should have seen 
him as he gazed wonderingly upon us, and my respect deepened for the woman 
who could, spite the hard lines of her rugged life, bring forth and 
preserve so much of childish symmetry and beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having absorbed these general facts, I turned to the master of 
this household.&nbsp; He was a man of small stature but rugged <!-- page 
695--><a name="page695"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 695</span>frame, and 
his left shirt sleeve dangled empty at his side.&nbsp; That adroit Finn, 
noticing my inquiring look, blurted out: &lsquo;That arm went in a street 
accident, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir; it wint at the battle of 
Spottsylvania.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here was a hero!&nbsp; The narrow limits of his humble home 
expanded to embrace the brown and kneaded Virginian glades as I saw them 
just seven years ago, pictured with the lurid pageantry of that stubborn 
fight when Sedgwick fell.&nbsp; This man, crammed with his family into 
twelve feet square at the top of Sweeney&rsquo;s Shambles, was once part of
that glorious scene.&nbsp; In answer to my test questions he said he 
belonged to the Thirty-ninth New York, which was attached to the Second 
Corps, and that he received a pension of $15 per month from the grateful 
country he had served as payment in full for an arm.&nbsp; It was enough to
keep body and soul together, and he could not complain.&nbsp; Nor could I; 
but I could and did signify to my guide by a nod that I had seen and heard 
enough, and we went down again into the slimy, reeking court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a square on the East side bounded by Houston, Stanton, Pitt, 
and Willett streets.&nbsp; It contains a group of three front and seven 
rear houses, and is known as &ldquo;Rag-pickers&rsquo; Row.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
These ten houses contain a total of 106 families, or 452 persons.&nbsp; All
these persons are rag-pickers, or more properly chiffonniers, for their 
business is to pick up every thing saleable they can find in the 
streets.&nbsp; Formerly they brought their gatherings to this place and 
assorted them here before taking them to the junk stores to sell 
them.&nbsp; Now, however, they assort them elsewhere, and their wretched 
dwellings are as clean as it is possible to keep them.&nbsp; They are 
generally peaceable and quiet, and their quarrels are commonly referred to 
the agent in charge of the row, who decides them to their 
satisfaction.&nbsp; They are very industrious in their callings, and some 
of them have money in the Savings banks.&nbsp; Nearly all who have children
send them to the Mission Schools.</p>
<p><!-- page 696--><a name="page696"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
696</span>The Board of Health, in one of their recent publications, express
themselves as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst class of tenement houses was those where a landlord had
accommodations for ten families, and these buildings comprise more than 
half of the tenement houses of the city, and accommodate fully two-thirds 
of the entire tenement-house population.&nbsp; When the number of families 
living under one owner exceeded ten, it was found that such owner was 
engaged in the keeping of a tenement-house as a business, and generally as 
a speculator.&nbsp; It is among this class of owners that nearly all the 
evils of the tenement-house system are found.&nbsp; The little colony 
exhibit in their rooms, and in the little areas around their dwellings, 
extreme want of care.&nbsp; The street in front of the place was reeking 
with slops and garbage; the alleys and passage ways were foul with 
excrements; the court was imperfectly paved, wet, and covered with domestic
refuse; the privies, located in a close court between the rear and front 
houses, were dilapidated, and gave out volumes of noisome odors, which 
filled the whole area, and were diffused through all the rooms opening upon
it; and the halls and apartments of the wretched occupants were close, 
unventilated, and unclean.&nbsp; The complaint was universal among the 
tenants that they are entirely uncared for, and that the only answer to 
their request to have the place put in order, by repairs and necessary 
improvements, was, that they must pay their rent or leave.&nbsp; Inquiry 
often disclosed the fact that the owner of the property was a wealthy 
gentleman or lady, either living in an aristocratic part of the city or in 
a neighboring city, or, as was occasionally found to be the case, in 
Europe.&nbsp; The property is usually managed entirely by an agent, whose 
instructions are simple, but emphatic, viz., &lsquo;collect the rent in 
advance, or, failing, eject the occupants.&rsquo;&nbsp; The profits on this
sort of property, so administered, are rarely less than fifteen per cent., 
and more generally thirty per cent. upon the investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evils of the tenement house system are almost incalculable.&nbsp; It
is the experience of all nations that barrack life is demoralizing, and the
tenement house is but a barrack without <!-- page 697--><a 
name="page697"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 697</span>the rigid discipline 
of a military establishment.&nbsp; Its inmates know no such thing as 
privacy.&nbsp; Home is but a word with them.&nbsp; They have habitations, 
but not homes.&nbsp; Within the same walls are gathered the virtuous and 
the depraved, the honest laborer and the thief.&nbsp; There can be no such 
thing as shielding the young from improper outside influences.&nbsp; They 
have every opportunity to become thoroughly corrupted without leaving the 
house.&nbsp; Decency is impossible.&nbsp; Families exist in the greatest 
amount of personal discomfort, and the children take every opportunity to 
escape from the house into the streets.&nbsp; The tenement houses every 
year send many girls into the ranks of the street walkers, and a greater 
number of young men into the ranks of the roughs and thieves.</p>
<p>Drunkenness is very common among the inhabitants of these houses.&nbsp; 
Men and women are literally driven into intemperance by the discomfort in 
which they live.&nbsp; Nearly all the domestic murders occurring in the 
city are perpetrated in the tenement houses.&nbsp; Immorality is very 
common.&nbsp; Indeed, the latter crime is the logical result of such dense 
packing of the sexes.&nbsp; It is a terrible thing to contemplate, but it 
is a fact that one half of the population of this great city is subjected 
to the demoralizing influences of these vast barracks.&nbsp; The laboring 
class, who should constitute the backbone and sinew of the community, are 
thus degraded to a level with paupers, forced to herd among them, and to 
adopt a mode of life which is utterly destructive of the characteristics 
which should distinguish them.&nbsp; It is no wonder that crime is so 
common in the Metropolis.&nbsp; The real wonder is that it does not defy 
all restraint.</p>
<p>The tenement houses are afflicted with a terrible mortality.&nbsp; Says 
Dr. Harris, &ldquo;Consumption and all the inflammatory diseases of the 
lungs vie with the infectious and other zymotic disorders, in wasting the 
health and destroying the life of the tenement population.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of 
late years a new disease, the relapsing fever, which, though rarely fatal, 
destroys the health and vigor of its victims, has made havoc among the 
tenement population.&nbsp; The mortality among children is very great, and 
perhaps this is fortunate for them, for it would seem that death in <!-- 
page 698--><a name="page698"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 698</span>their 
first flush of innocence is far better than a life of wretchedness and 
perhaps of infamy.&nbsp; Small pox and all the contagious and infectious 
diseases would make short work with the tenement-house population, were any
of them to become epidemic in the city.&nbsp; There would be nothing to 
check them, and the unfortunate people living in these sections would find 
no means of escaping from them.</p>
<h2><!-- page 699--><a name="page699"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
699</span>LXI.&nbsp; CHATHAM STREET.</h2>
<p>The oldest inhabitant cannot remember when Chatham street did not 
exist.&nbsp; It still contains many half decayed houses which bear witness 
to its antiquity.&nbsp; It begins at City Hall Place, and ends at Chatham 
Square.&nbsp; It is not over a quarter of a mile in length, and is narrow 
and dirty.&nbsp; The inhabitants are principally Jews and low class 
foreigners.&nbsp; Near the lower end are one or two good restaurants, and 
several cheap hotels, but the remainder of the street is taken up with 
establishments into which respectable buyers do not care to venture.&nbsp; 
Cheap lodging houses abound, pawnbrokers are numerous, several fence stores
are to be found here, and some twenty or twenty-five cellars are occupied 
as dance houses and concert saloons.&nbsp; These are among the lowest and 
vilest of their kind in New York.</p>
<p>Chatham street is the paradise of dealers in mock jewelry and old 
clothes.&nbsp; Some of the shops sell new clothing of an inferior quality, 
but old clothes do most abound.&nbsp; Here you may find the cast-off finery
of the wife of a millionaire&mdash;the most of it stolen&mdash;or the 
discarded rags of a pauper.&nbsp; It seems as if all New York had placed 
its cast-off clothing here for sale, and that the stock had accumulated for
generations.&nbsp; Who the dealers sell to is a mystery.&nbsp; You see them
constantly inviting trade, but you rarely see a customer within their 
doors.</p>

<img alt="CHATHAM SQUARE." src="images/p700.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Honesty is a stranger in Chatham street, and any one making a purchase 
here must expect to be cheated.&nbsp; The streets running off to the right 
and left lead to the Five Points and similar sections, and it is this 
wretched portion of the city that supports trade in Chatham street.&nbsp; 
The horse car lines of the east side <!-- page 701--><a 
name="page701"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 701</span>pass through the 
entire length of the street, and the heaviest portion of the city travel 
flows through it, but respectable people rarely leave the cars in this 
dirty thoroughfare, and are heartily glad when they are well out of 
it.&nbsp; The buildings are generally old and dilapidated.&nbsp; The shops 
are low and dark.&nbsp; They are rank with foul odors, and are suggestive 
of disease.&nbsp; The men and women who conduct them look like convicts, 
and as they sit in their doorways watching for custom, they seem more like 
wild beasts waiting for their prey, than like human beings.&nbsp; Even the 
children have a keener, more disreputable appearance here than 
elsewhere.&nbsp; The lowest class Jews abound in this vile quarter, and 
filthy creatures they are.</p>
<p>The Chatham street merchants are shrewd dealers, and never suffer an 
opportunity to make a penny to pass by unimproved.&nbsp; They are not 
particular as to the character of the transaction.&nbsp; They know they are
never expected to sell honestly, and they make it a rule not to disappoint 
their customers.&nbsp; One of their favorite expedients to create trade in 
dull times is called a &ldquo;forced sale.&rdquo;&nbsp; They practise this 
only on those whom they recognize as strangers, for long experience has 
enabled them to tell a city man at a glance.&nbsp; A stranger walking along
the street will be accosted by the proprietor of a shop and his clerks with
offers of &ldquo;sheap&rdquo; clothing.&nbsp; If he pauses to listen, he is
lost.&nbsp; He is seized by the harpies, who pretend to assist him, and is 
literally forced into the shop.&nbsp; He may protest that he does not wish 
to buy anything, but the &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; and his clerks will insist 
that he does, and before he can well help himself, they will haul off his 
coat, clap one of the store coats on his back, and declare it a 
&ldquo;perfect fit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The new coat will then be removed and 
replaced by the old one, and the victim will be allowed to leave the 
shop.&nbsp; As he passes out of the door, the new coat is thrust under his 
arm, and he is seized by the proprietor and his assistants, who shout 
&ldquo;stop thief!&rdquo; and charge him with stealing the coat.&nbsp; 
Their noise, and the dread of being arrested upon a charge of theft, will 
frequently so confuse and frighten the victim that he will comply with 
their demand, which is that he shall buy the coat.&nbsp; This done he is 
suffered to <!-- page 702--><a name="page702"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
702</span>depart.&nbsp; A refusal to yield would not injure him, for the 
scoundrels would seldom dare to call in the police, for fear of getting 
themselves into trouble with the officials.&nbsp; They have reckoned with 
certainty, however, upon the stranger&rsquo;s timidity and bewilderment, 
and know they are safe.</p>
<h2><!-- page 703--><a name="page703"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
703</span>LXII.&nbsp; JAMES GORDON BENNETT.</h2>
<p>James Gordon Bennett was born at New Mill, Keith, in Banffshire, on the 
northeastern coast of Scotland, about the year 1800.&nbsp; His relatives 
were Roman Catholics, and he was destined for the priesthood of that 
church.&nbsp; He entered the Roman Catholic Seminary at Aberdeen, in 1814, 
and remained there two years, acquiring the basis of an excellent 
education.&nbsp; Chance having thrown in his way a copy of Benjamin 
Franklin&rsquo;s Autobiography, he was so much impressed by it that he 
abandoned all thought of a clerical life, and resolved to emigrate to 
America, which he did in 1819, arriving in Halifax in May of that year, 
being then nearly twenty years old.&nbsp; He had not an acquaintance on 
this side of the Atlantic, had no profession save that of a bookkeeper, and
had but twenty-five dollars in his pocket.</p>
<p>He began by giving lessons in bookkeeping, in Halifax, but his success 
was so poor that he came to the United States, landing at Portland, where 
he took passage for Boston.&nbsp; Arriving in Boston he found great 
difficulty in procuring employment, and was reduced to the verge of 
starvation, but at length obtained a place as a proof-reader.&nbsp; He held
this position for two years, and, having lost it by the failure of his 
employers, came to New York in 1822.&nbsp; Soon after this, he accepted an 
engagement on the <i>Charleston</i> (S.C.) <i>Courier</i>, but held it for 
a short time only.&nbsp; Returning to New York he attempted to organize a 
Commercial School, but was unsuccessful.&nbsp; He next tried lecturing, 
with equally bad luck, and was obliged to renew his connection with the 
press.&nbsp; He held various positions on the New York newspapers, in each 
and all of which he proved himself a journalist of large ideas and great 
originality and power.&nbsp; <!-- page 704--><a name="page704"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 704</span>In 1828, he became the Washington 
correspondent of the <i>New York Enquirer</i>, and in this position 
inaugurated the style of newspaper correspondence which is now adopted by 
all the leading journals of the country.&nbsp; He was poorly paid for his 
services, and was obliged to do an immense amount of miscellaneous literary
work in order to earn a bare support.&nbsp; In the autumn of 1829 he became
assistant editor of the <i>Courier and Enquirer</i>, with James Watson Webb
as his chief.&nbsp; In this position he did great service, and really made 
the success of the paper.&nbsp; He found his position unpleasant, however, 
and abandoned it in 1832.</p>
<p>He tried several other expedients, all of which were unsuccessful, and 
even tried to induce Horace Greeley, then a struggling printer, to join him
in the establishment of a newspaper.&nbsp; Horace refused, but recommended 
him to another printer who accepted his proposition.&nbsp; His next step 
was to rent a cellar in Wall street, and in this cellar, on the 6th of May,
1835, the <i>New York Herald</i> was born.&nbsp; The coal vaults of the 
present <i>Herald</i> office are an improvement upon the original office, 
which was sanctum and counting-house all in one.&nbsp; Mr. Bennett 
performed all the work on the paper, except setting it up and printing 
it.&nbsp; He collected the news, wrote the contents, sold the paper, and 
received advertisements.&nbsp; He worked manfully, but his difficulties 
were enormous.&nbsp; He made his little journal spicy, attractive, and even
impudent&mdash;though not indecent, as some have wrongly asserted&mdash;in 
the hope of making it popular.&nbsp; He worked from sixteen to eighteen 
hours a day, but in spite of all his efforts he lost money until the end of
the third month, after which he contrived to pay the actual expense of 
publication for some time longer.&nbsp; Then a fire destroyed the printing 
office, and his partners refused to continue their connection with the 
paper.&nbsp; By almost superhuman efforts he succeeded in securing the 
means of going on with the <i>Herald</i>, and in a short while the 
&ldquo;great fire&rdquo; occurred just in time to save him.&nbsp; It was 
the most terrible catastrophe that had ever occurred in America, and 
Bennett resolved to profit by it.&nbsp; He went himself among the ruins, 
note-book in hand, and the result of his labors was a series of graphic and
accurate reports in <!-- page 705--><a name="page705"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 705</span>the <i>Herald</i> of the disaster, that at 
once created a large demand for the paper.&nbsp; This demand did not fall 
off, but it was not sufficient to place the <i>Herald</i> on a successful 
footing.&nbsp; At this time, Mr. Bennett was fortunate enough to secure a 
large contract from Dr. Brandreth for advertising his pills in the 
<i>Herald</i>.&nbsp; The sum received was very large, and was 
conscientiously expended in the purchase of news, and in improving and 
increasing the attractions of the paper.&nbsp; At the end of the fifteenth 
month of its career, Mr. Bennett ventured to increase the size of the 
<i>Herald</i>, and to raise its price from one to two cents.&nbsp; Since 
then the paper has prospered steadily, and is now one of the wealthiest and
most powerful journals in the land, and the best purveyor of news in the 
world.&nbsp; Its success is due almost exclusively to the proprietor.&nbsp;
Mr. Bennett has not only built up his own paper, but has revolutionized the
press of the world.&nbsp; This is his chief claim to distinction.</p>
<p>He rarely writes for the paper now, though he maintains a close

706</span>LXIII.&nbsp; DRUNKENNESS.</h2>
<p>During the year 1869, there were 15,918 men, and 8105 women arrested for
intoxication, and 5222 men and 3466 women for intoxication and disorderly 
conduct, making a total of 21,140 men and 11,571 women, or 32,711 persons 
in all arrested for drunkenness.&nbsp; Now if to this we add the 21,734 men
and women arrested during the same year for assault and battery, and for 
disorderly conduct, and regard these offences as caused, as they 
undoubtedly were, by liquor, we shall have a total of 54,445 persons 
brought to grief by the use of intoxicating liquors.</p>
<p>But it does not require this estimate to convince a New Yorker that 
drunkenness is very common in the city.&nbsp; One has but to walk through 
the streets, and especially those in the poorer sections, and notice the 
liquor shops of various kinds, from the Broadway rum palace to the 
&ldquo;Gin Mill&rdquo; of the Bowery, or the &ldquo;Bucket Shop&rdquo; of 
the Five Points.&nbsp; There are 7071 licensed places for the sale of 
liquor in the city, and they all enjoy a greater or less degree of 
prosperity.&nbsp; Very few liquor sellers, confining themselves to their 
legitimate business, fail in this city.&nbsp; The majority grow rich, and 
their children not unfrequently take their places in the fashionable 
society of the city.&nbsp; The liquors sold at these places are simply 
abominable.&nbsp; Whiskey commands the largest sale, and it is in the 
majority of instances a vile compound.&nbsp; About three years ago, the 
<i>New York World</i> published a list of the principal bar-rooms of the 
city, with a report of chemical analyses of the liquors obtained at each, 
and proved conclusively that pure liquors were not sold over the bar at any
establishment in the city.&nbsp; A few <!-- page 707--><a 
name="page707"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 707</span>months ago a 
<i>World</i> reporter published the following estimate of the business of 
the bar-rooms in the vicinity of Wall street, patronized principally by the
brokers:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This makes a total of 5281 drinks and 94 bottles of champagne 
consumed in thirteen of the largest saloons, supported by the brokers; and 
including the dozen or more of small places, the number of drinks taken in 
and about Wall street per day is over 7500, while over 125 bottles of 
champagne are disposed of.&nbsp; The amount of money expended for fuel to 
feed the flagging energies of the speculators is, therefore, over $2000 per
day, and it is not at all strange that the brokers occasionally cut up 
queer antics in the boards, and stocks take twists and turns that unsettle 
the street for weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brokers, however, are not the only generous patrons of the 
bar-rooms.&nbsp; The vice of drunkenness pervades all classes.&nbsp; Every 
day men are being ruined by it, and the most promising careers totally 
destroyed.&nbsp; Day after day, you see men and women reeling along the 
streets, or falling helpless.&nbsp; The police soon secure them, and at 
night they are kept quite busy <!-- page 708--><a name="page708"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 708</span>attending to them.&nbsp; But the arrests, 
numerous as they are, do not represent the sum total of the drunkenness of 
the city.&nbsp; The drinking in private life, which oftentimes does not 
result in actual intoxication, but which kills by slowly poisoning body and
mind, is very great, but there is no means of estimating it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Respectable men patronize the better class bar-rooms, and respectable 
women the ladies&rsquo; restaurants.&nbsp; At the latter places a very 
large amount of money is spent by women for drink.&nbsp; <!-- page 709--><a
name="page709"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 709</span>Wives and mothers, 
and even young girls, who are ashamed to drink at home, go to these 
fashionable restaurants for their liquor.&nbsp; Some will drink it openly, 
others will disguise it as much as possible.&nbsp; Absinthe has been 
introduced at these places of late years, and it is said to be very popular
with the gentler sex.&nbsp; Those who know its effects will shudder at 
this.&nbsp; We have seen many drunken women in New York, and the majority 
have been well dressed and of respectable appearance.&nbsp; Not long since,
a lady making purchases in a city store, fell helpless to the floor.&nbsp; 
The salesman, thinking she had fainted, hastened to her assistance, and 
found her dead drunk.</p>
<p>We have already written of the Bucket Shops.&nbsp; They represent the 
lowest grade of this vice.&nbsp; They sell nothing but poisons.</p>
<p>Is it strange then that crime flourishes?&nbsp; Is it a wonder that 
Saturday night and Sunday, the chosen periods for drinking heavily, are 
productive of more murders and assaults than any other portion of the 
week?</p>
<h2><!-- page 710--><a name="page710"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
710</span>LXIV.&nbsp; WHAT IT COSTS TO LIVE IN NEW YORK.</h2>
<p>The question is very frequently asked, &ldquo;Is living in New York very
expensive?&rdquo;&nbsp; An emphatic affirmative may be safely returned to 
every such interrogatory.&nbsp; Let one&rsquo;s idea of comfort be what it 
may, it is impossible to live cheaply in this city with any degree of 
decency.&nbsp; One can go to a cellar lodging-house, and live for from 
twenty to forty cents a day, but he will find himself overcharged for the 
accommodation given him.&nbsp; He may live in a tenement house, and his 
expenses will still be disproportioned to the return received.&nbsp; The 
discomforts of life in New York, however, fall chiefly upon educated and 
refined people of moderate means.&nbsp; The very rich have an abundance for
their wants, and are able to make their arrangements to suit 
themselves.&nbsp; The very poor expect nothing but misery.</p>
<p>To begin at the beginning, the expenses of a family in fashionable life 
are something appalling.&nbsp; Fifty thousand dollars per annum may be set 
down as the average outlay of a family of five or six persons residing in a
fashionable street, and owning their residence.&nbsp; Some persons spend 
more, some less, but this amount may be taken as a fair average, and it 
will not admit of much of what would be called extravagance in such a 
station.</p>
<p>For those who own their houses, keep a carriage, and do not &ldquo;live 
fashionably,&rdquo; or give many entertainments, the average is from 
fifteen to twenty thousand dollars.</p>
<p>For those who aspire to live in comfort and in a respectable 
neighborhood, and to occupy a whole house, the average is from five to six 
thousand dollars.&nbsp; With six thousand dollars a year, a family of five 
persons, living in a rented house, will be compelled to economise.&nbsp; 
Those who have smaller incomes are <!-- page 711--><a 
name="page711"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 711</span>obliged to board, to 
occupy a part of a house, or to leave the city.</p>
<p>The average rent of a moderate sized house in New York is $1800 per 
annum.&nbsp; This amount may or may not include the use of the gas 
fixtures, and the house may or may not have a furnace in it.&nbsp; There 
will be a dining-room and kitchen, with hall or passage in the 
basement.&nbsp; The first floor will contain two parlors and the front 
hall.&nbsp; The second floor will contain a bath-room, water closet, and 
two, or perhaps three, chambers.&nbsp; The third floor usually contains two
large and two small rooms, and several closets.&nbsp; The chambers in the 
more modern houses contain marble basins, with hot and cold water laid 
on.&nbsp; Where the tenant is unknown to the landlord, he is required to 
pay his rent monthly, in advance, or to give security for its quarterly 
payment.&nbsp; Such a house will require the services of at least two 
women, and if there be children to be cared for, a nurse is 
necessary.&nbsp; The wages of these, per month, are as follows: cook, $16 
to $20; chambermaid, $12 to $15; nurse, $12 to $16.&nbsp; In many of the 
wealthier families a higher rate of wages is paid.&nbsp; At the rate given,
however, from $480 to $582 is the annual outlay for servants, to which must
be added a considerable sum for &ldquo;changing help.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Instances are known to the writer in which this &ldquo;changing 
help,&rdquo; in the case of discharging an old cook and securing a new one,
has cost a housekeeper as much as $30 in a single change.&nbsp; This will 
be easily understood when I state that ladies who go to look after 
&ldquo;girls,&rdquo; in the places from which they advertise for 
situations, are obliged to go to the expense of hiring a carriage, it being
unsafe for them to venture into these sections on foot.&nbsp; Without 
counting the changes, however, and taking the lower estimate of wages, we 
have a total of $2280 for house rent and servants&rsquo; hire.&nbsp; This 
leaves, from $6000, the sum of $3720 for food, clothing, sickness, 
education, and all the incidentals of a family.&nbsp; The General 
Government secures a large slice of this through its iniquitous income tax,
and State and county taxes take up several hundred more.&nbsp; Those who 
have had experience in keeping house in any portion of the country can 
easily understand how the rest goes, <!-- page 712--><a 
name="page712"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 712</span>when one has to pay 
fifty cents per pound for butter, fifty cents a dozen for eggs, sixteen 
cents a pound for crushed sugar, twenty-five cents a pound for fowls, and 
thirty-five cents a pound for the choice cuts of beef.&nbsp; All this, too,
with the certainty of getting light weights from your butcher and 
grocer.</p>
<p>Many persons seek refuge in boarding.&nbsp; Those who have no children, 
or but one or two, may live cheaper in this way, but not in the same degree
of comfort that their outlay would bring them in their own homes.&nbsp; A 
couple with two or three children and a nurse, cannot live in any 
respectable boarding-house in New York, except in instances so rare that 
they do not deserve to be mentioned, for less than sixty dollars per week 
for board and lodging alone.&nbsp; Such persons must pay extra for washing,
and there are many &ldquo;incidentals&rdquo; which add to the 
landlady&rsquo;s receipts.</p>
<p>For such a family, giving them two chambers and a parlor, the Fifth 
Avenue Hotel charges $30 per day, or $10,950 per annum.&nbsp; The figures 
are high, but &ldquo;the Fifth Avenue&rdquo; gives a fair return for the 
money.&nbsp; The charges of the other hotels are in proportion.&nbsp; None 
of them will receive such a family for less than $6000 or $7000 per 
annum.</p>
<p>Of late years, a new style of living has been introduced.&nbsp; The city
now contains a number of houses located in unexceptionable neighborhoods, 
and built in first-class style, which are rented in flats, or suites of 
apartments, as in the Parisian houses.&nbsp; The largest of these are the 
monster &ldquo;Stevens House,&rdquo; on Twenty-seventh street, fronting on 
Broadway and Fifth avenue, Dr. Haight&rsquo;s House, on the corner of Fifth
avenue and Fifteenth street, and Mr. Stuyvesant&rsquo;s House, in East 
Eighteenth street, the last of which was the pioneer house of its kind in 
this city.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Stevens House&rdquo; was built and is owned by 
Paran Stevens, Esq., and is one of the largest buildings in the city.&nbsp;
It is constructed of red brick, with marble and light stone trimmings, and 
is eight stories in height above the street, with a large cellar below the 
sidewalk.&nbsp; The cost of this edifice is to be one million of 
dollars.&nbsp; &ldquo;The woodwork of the interior is of black walnut; the 
walls are finely frescoed and harmoniously tinted.&nbsp; <!-- page 713--><a
name="page713"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 713</span>There are, in all, 
eight floors, including the servants&rsquo; attics.&nbsp; Five stores 
occupy the lower tier.&nbsp; There are eighteen suites of rooms, to which 
access is had by a steam elevator.&nbsp; The building is heated upon the 
principle of indirect radiation, by forcing steam-heated air through pipes 
into the different rooms.&nbsp; The main staircase is of iron, with marble 
steps, and the main halls to each story are tiled.&nbsp; The chief suites 
comprise parlor, dining-room, boudoir, dressing-rooms, and butler&rsquo;s 
pantry; each principal suite comprehending five commodious chambers on the 
first floor, and two at the top of the house.&nbsp; Each kitchen is 
furnished with improved ranges.&nbsp; The roof is supplied with water 
tanks, and, as a further protection against fire, the second floor is 
supported by iron arched beams, filled in with concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Haight House is said to be the most thoroughly comfortable 
establishment of the kind in New York.&nbsp; &ldquo;It consists of five 
floors, having twenty suites of apartments for families, and fifteen for 
bachelors, at a yearly rental of from three thousand to two thousand 
dollars for the former, and from one thousand four hundred to six hundred 
and fifty dollars for the latter.&nbsp; These suites are entered from the 
hallways, each suite having a separate entrance of its own, and at the 
entrance to the principal suites there is a small antechamber, from which a
servant may announce the names of visitors.&nbsp; The family suites embrace
a commodious parlor, a large dining-room, with butler&rsquo;s pantry 
attached, a kitchen, three bed rooms, and a bath room.&nbsp; Each suite has
its own dumb-waiter; a dump for coal and refuse, and the proper provision 
for ventilation; while the suites intended for single occupants are 
furnished with every appliance necessary to the securing of perfect comfort
and ease.&nbsp; Although every accommodation is furnished by the house, 
some of the tenants have chosen to go to the expense of decorating their 
own apartments, and have had their rooms elegantly frescoed and painted by 
some of the first artists in the city.&nbsp; The mantels are either of 
walnut or the finest marble, of elegant design and workmanship.&nbsp; The 
supposition is that a majority of the guests will cook for themselves, but 
arrangements may be effected by which the cooking may be done in a general 
kitchen for the purpose.&nbsp; <!-- page 714--><a name="page714"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 714</span>There is a steam elevator, and a general 
system of kitchens, sculleries, pantries, store and ice rooms, with the 
engines, and a well-devised workshop for the engineer.&nbsp; There is a 
steam laundry, capable of washing one thousand pieces per day, where guests
may have their washing done at a cheaper rate than could be possible under 
any of the ordinary methods; and also a drying room&mdash;all of the 
principal work of the establishment being effected by steam.&nbsp; Each 
apartment has its bell and whistle, communicating with the basement.&nbsp; 
A janitor, or porter, has a lodge in the main hall, within which there is 
also a &lsquo;post-office.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the basement is another 
porter&rsquo;s lodge for the facilitation of business with the butcher, the
baker, and the expressman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These houses, however, are accessible only to people of ample 
means.&nbsp; The apartments rent for sums which will secure comfortable 
dwellings, and the other expenses are about the same one would incur in his
own house.&nbsp; The great need of the city is a system of such houses in 
respectable neighborhoods, in which apartments may be had at moderate 
rents.</p>
<h2><!-- page 715--><a name="page715"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
715</span>LXV.&nbsp; GAMBLING.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; FARO BANKS.</h3>
<p>In spite of the fact that games of chance for money are prohibited by 
the laws of the State of New York, there is no city in the Union in which 
they are carried on to a greater extent than in the Metropolis.&nbsp; There
are about 200 gambling houses proper in the city, and from 350 to 400 
lottery offices, policy shops, and places where gambling is carried on with
more or less regularity.&nbsp; About 2500 persons are known to the police 
as professional gamblers.&nbsp; Some of the establishments are conducted 
with great secrecy.&nbsp; Others are carried on with perfect openness, and 
are as well known as any place of legitimate business in the city.&nbsp; 
The police, for reasons best known to themselves, decline to execute the 
laws against them, and they continue their career from year to year without
molestation.&nbsp; There are about twenty of these houses in Broadway, 
occupying locations which make them conspicuous to every passer-by.&nbsp; 
In the cross streets, within a block of Broadway, there are from 
twenty-five to thirty more, and the Bowery and East side streets are full 
of them.</p>
<p>Ninety-five of the gambling houses of the city are classed as 
&ldquo;Faro Banks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Faro is the principal game, but there are 
appliances for others.&nbsp; Faro is emphatically an American game, and is 
preferred by amateurs because of its supposed fairness.&nbsp; An 
experienced gambler, however, does not need to be told that the game offers
as many chances for cheating as any others that <!-- page 716--><a 
name="page716"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 716</span>are played.&nbsp; It 
has attained its highest development in New York.</p>
<p>The gambling houses of New York are usually divided into three classes: 
First and Second Class, and Day Houses.&nbsp; The First-Class Houses are 
few in number.&nbsp; There are probably not more than half a dozen in all, 
if as many.&nbsp; In these houses the playing is fair&mdash;that is, 
cheating is never resorted to.&nbsp; The Bank relies upon the chances in 
its favor, the &ldquo;splits,&rdquo; and the superior skill and experience 
of the dealer.&nbsp; The first-class houses are located in fashionable side
streets leading from Broadway, and are easy of access.&nbsp; Outwardly they
differ in nothing from the elegant mansions on either side of them, except 
that the blinds are closed all day long, and the house has a silent, 
deserted air.&nbsp; In its internal arrangements the house is 
magnificent.&nbsp; The furniture, carpets, and all its appointments are 
superb.&nbsp; Choice paintings and works of art are scattered through the 
rooms in truly regal profusion.&nbsp; All that money can do to make the 
place attractive and luxurious has been done, and as money can always 
command taste, the work has been well done.</p>
<p>The servants attached to the place are generally negroes of the better 
class.&nbsp; They are well trained, many of them having been brought up as 
the <i>valets</i>, or butlers of the Southern gentry, and answer better for
such places than whites, inasmuch as they are quiet, uncommunicative, 
attentive and respectful.&nbsp; One of these men is always in charge of the
front door, and visitors are admitted with caution, it being highly 
desirable to admit only the nominally respectable.&nbsp; The best known 
houses are those of Morrissey, in Twenty-fourth street, and Ransom&rsquo;s 
and Chamberlain&rsquo;s, in Twenty-fifth street.&nbsp; Chamberlain&rsquo;s 
is, perhaps, the most palatial and the best conducted establishment in the 
country.</p>

<img alt="A FIRST-CLASS GAMBLING HOUSE." src="images/p717.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The house is a magnificent brown-stone mansion, not far from 
Broadway.&nbsp; Ascending the broad stone steps, and ringing the bell, the 
visitor is ushered into the hall by the man in charge of the door, who is 
selected with great care.&nbsp; An attentive colored servant takes his hat 
and overcoat, and throws open the door of the drawing rooms.&nbsp; These 
apartments are furnished with <!-- page 718--><a name="page718"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 718</span>taste as well as with magnificence.&nbsp; The 
carpet is of velvet, and the foot sinks noiselessly into it.&nbsp; The 
walls are tinted with delicate shades of lavender, and the ceiling is 
exquisitely frescoed.&nbsp; The furniture is of a beautiful design, and is 
upholstered in colors which harmonize with the prevailing tint of the walls
and ceiling.&nbsp; The mantels are of Vermont marble, and over each is a 
large wall mirror.&nbsp; At each end of the room is a long pier glass, 
placed between richly curtained windows.&nbsp; Fine bronzes are scattered 
about the room, and in the front parlor are large and well-executed copies 
of Dora&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dante and Virgil in the Frozen Regions of 
Hell,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jephthah&rsquo;s Daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The front 
parlor is entirely devoted to the reception and entertainment of 
guests.&nbsp; The gaming is carried on in the back parlor.</p>
<p>In the rear of the back parlor is the supper room, one of the richest 
and most tasteful apartments in the city.&nbsp; A long table, capable of 
seating fifty guests, is spread every evening with the finest of linen, 
plate, and table-ware.&nbsp; The best the market can afford is spread here 
every night.&nbsp; The steward of the establishment is an accomplished 
member of his profession, and is invaluable to his employer, who gives him 
free scope for the exercise of his talents.&nbsp; There is not a better 
table in all New York.&nbsp; The wines and cigars are of the finest brands,
and are served in the greatest profusion.&nbsp; Chamberlain well 
understands that a good table is an important adjunct to his business, and 
he makes the attraction as strong as possible.&nbsp; There is no charge for
the supper, or for liquors or cigars, but the guests are men above the 
petty meanness of enjoying all these luxuries without making some return 
for them.&nbsp; This return is made through the medium of the card 
table.</p>
<p>The proprietor of the house, John Chamberlain, is one of the handsomest 
men in the city.&nbsp; He is of middle height, compactly built, with a fine
head, with black hair and eyes, and small features.&nbsp; His expression is
pleasant and winning, and he is said to be invariably good natured, even 
under the most trying circumstances.&nbsp; In manner he is a thorough-bred 
gentleman, and exceedingly attractive.&nbsp; He is of middle age, and is 
finely educated.&nbsp; His self-possession is remarkable, and never <!-- 
page 719--><a name="page719"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 719</span>deserts
him, and he has the quality of putting his guests thoroughly at their 
ease.&nbsp; In short, he is a man fitted to adorn any position in life, and
capable of reaching a very high one, but who has chosen to place himself in
a position which both the law and popular sentiment have branded as 
infamous.&nbsp; Indeed, his very attractions and amiable qualities make him
a very dangerous member of the community.&nbsp; He draws to the card table 
many who would be repelled from it by the ordinary gambler, and the 
fairness with which he conducts his house renders it all the more dangerous
to society.</p>
<p>The guests consist of the most distinguished men in the city and 
country.&nbsp; Chamberlain says frankly that he does not care to receive 
visitors who are possessed of limited incomes and to whom losses would 
bring misfortune.&nbsp; He says it hurts him more to win the money of a man
on a salary, especially if he has a family, than to lose his own, and as he
does not care to be a loser he keeps these people away as far as 
possible.&nbsp; In plain English, he wishes to demoralize only the higher 
classes of society.&nbsp; His visitors are chiefly men who are wealthy and 
who can afford to lose, or whose high social or political stations make 
them welcome guests.&nbsp; You may see at his table Governors, Senators, 
members of Congress and of Legislatures, generals, judges, lawyers, 
bankers, merchants, great operators in Wall street, famous actors and 
authors, journalists, artists&mdash;in short, all grades of men who have 
attained eminence or won wealth in their callings.&nbsp; Consequently, the 
company is brilliant, and the conversations are such as are seldom heard in
the most aristocratic private mansions of the city.&nbsp; The early part of
the evening is almost exclusively devoted to social enjoyment, and there is
very little gambling until after supper, which is served about half-past 
eleven, after the theatres have closed.</p>
<p>Then the back parlor is the centre of attraction.&nbsp; There is a 
roulette table on the eastern side of this apartment, said to be the 
handsomest piece of furniture in the Union.&nbsp; At the opposite side is a
large side-board bountifully provided with liquor and cigars.&nbsp; The 
faro table stands across the room at the southern end, and is the most 
popular resort of the guests, though <!-- page 720--><a 
name="page720"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 720</span>some of the other 
games find their votaries in other parts of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The table upon which faro is played is not unlike an ordinary 
dining-table with rounded corners.&nbsp; At the middle of one side, the 
place generally occupied by the head of a family, the dealer sits in a 
space of about three square feet, which has been fashioned in from the 
table.&nbsp; The surface is covered with tightly drawn green ladies&rsquo; 
cloth.&nbsp; The thirteen suit cards of a whist pack are inlaid upon the 
surface in two rows, with the odd card placed as at the round of the letter
U.&nbsp; The dealer has a full pack, which he shuffles, then inserts in a 
silver box with an open face.&nbsp; This box is laid upon the table 
directly to his front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cards are confined within it by a stiff spring, and the top 
card is visible to all, save a narrow strip running about its edge, which 
is necessarily covered by the rim of the box to hold it securely in 
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The game now begins.&nbsp; The dealer pushes out the top card, 
and the second card acted upon by the spring rises and fills its 
place.&nbsp; The second card is pushed off likewise laterally through the 
narrow slit constructed for the exit of all the cards.&nbsp; This pair thus
drawn out constitutes a &lsquo;turn,&rsquo; the first one being the winning
and the second the losing card; so that the first, third, fifth, and in the
same progression throughout the fifty-two are winning cards, and the 
second, fourth and sixth, etc., are the losing cards.&nbsp; The betting is 
done this way: The player buys ivory checks and never uses money 
openly.&nbsp; The checks are white, red, blue, and purple.&nbsp; The white 
checks are one dollar each, the red five dollars, the blue twenty-five and 
the purple one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having provided himself with the number of checks (which in size 
resemble an old-fashioned cent), he lays down any amount to suit his fancy 
on any one card upon the table&mdash;one of the thirteen described.&nbsp; 
Suppose the deal is about to begin.&nbsp; He puts $100 in checks on the 
ace.&nbsp; The dealer throws off the cards till finally an ace 
appears.&nbsp; If it be the third, fifth, seventh, etc., card the player 
wins, and the dealer pays him $100 in checks&mdash;the 
&lsquo;bank&rsquo;s&rsquo; loss.&nbsp; If, however, it were the second, 
<!-- page 721--><a name="page721"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
721</span>fourth, sixth, etc., card the dealer takes the checks and the 
bank is $100 winner.&nbsp; Should a player desire to bet on a card to lose,
he expresses this intention by putting a &lsquo;copper&rsquo; in his 
checks, and then if the card is thrown off from the pack by the dealer as a
losing card the player wins.&nbsp; This is practically all there is in 
faro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be remembered that the losing cards fall on one pile 
and the winning cards on another.&nbsp; When only four cards remain in the 
box there is generally lively betting as to how the three under cards will 
come out in precise order, the top one being visible.&nbsp; In this 
instance alone the player can treble his stake if fortunate in his 
prediction.&nbsp; This evolution is a &lsquo;call.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tally board is kept, showing what cards remain in the box after
each turn.&nbsp; This provision is to guard the player.&nbsp; Of course 
four of each kind are thrown from the box&mdash;four aces, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one will inquire how does the bank make it pay while taking 
such even chances?&nbsp; In this way.&nbsp; If two of a kind should come 
out in one &lsquo;turn,&rsquo; as, for instance, two aces, half of the 
money bet on the ace, either to win or lose, goes to the bank.&nbsp; This 
is known as a &lsquo;split.&nbsp; They are very frequent, and large sums 
pass to the dealer through this channel.&nbsp; That is where the bank makes
the money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chamberlain says that if men were to study and labor ten thousand
years they could never beat the bank, or rather the game.&nbsp; It is 
something which no one understands.&nbsp; When only one of a kind remains 
in the box, as an ace, for instance, to bet then that the card will come to
win or to lose is just like throwing up a copper and awaiting the result, 
head or tail.&nbsp; So it will be seen that the bank is in a position where
it has everything to risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The playing is conducted largely by means of checks on the 
National banks of the city, men seldom carrying money about their 
persons.&nbsp; Here Mr. Chamberlain has to use his wits.&nbsp; A check 
given for gaming purposes is not valid in law.&nbsp; Therefore it is 
necessary to know his man&mdash;to be sure of his wealth, to be certain of 
his credit.&nbsp; It requires instantaneous <!-- page 722--><a 
name="page722"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 722</span>decision.&nbsp; If 
the check is refused the drawer is mortally offended.&nbsp; But a few 
evenings since a city millionaire offered his check; it was declined.&nbsp;
This was Chamberlain&rsquo;s mistake.&nbsp; It is said that if a merchant 
repudiates his gambling check at the bank it will destroy his credit in 
commercial circles.&nbsp; This is the only safeguard upon which the faro 
bank relies.&nbsp; It shows, however, to what a dangerous extent gambling 
has laid hold of the mercantile community, how rottenness is at this hour 
the inward germ of apparent soundness, and how heads of heavy concerns 
fritter away their capital at faro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The largest number of business men who play at 
Chamberlain&rsquo;s are stock brokers, and these persons say openly that it
is a fairer game than the cunning and unscrupulous gambling of Wall 
street.&nbsp; The brokers, as well as other patrons, go in the night time 
to try and regain what they lost by day in speculation.&nbsp; Thus they 
alternate between one gaming resort and the other throughout the 
year.&nbsp; At the faro table they may lose several thousand dollars; but 
this they consider equivalent pay for rich suppers, costly wines, fine 
cigars and a merry time, and they are willing to pay for fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the opportunities which Chamberlain affords to his 
patrons to lose or win, as luck may direct, he keeps a sort of midnight 
national bank, where he will cash a check for any man he knows as a 
reliable party, and many who never think of gambling take advantage of his 
accommodating spirit.&nbsp; This is why he is reputed a good and valuable 
neighbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How skilfully contrived are all these minuti&aelig; of a gambling
palace!&nbsp; They seduce even those who would gladly have never seen a 
game of chance, and before one is aware of his danger he is past 
redemption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to the first-class houses come the Second-Class Houses, or 
&ldquo;Hells,&rdquo; as they are called in the city.&nbsp; These lie 
principally along Broadway and the side streets leading from it, and in the
Bowery.&nbsp; They are numerous, and are the most frequented by 
strangers.&nbsp; They are neither as elegantly furnished, nor as exclusive 
as to their guests, as the first-class houses.&nbsp; Any one may visit 
them, and they keep a regular force of runners, or <!-- page 723--><a 
name="page723"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 723</span>&ldquo;ropers 
in,&rdquo; for the purpose of enticing strangers within their walls.&nbsp; 
They are located over stores, as a general rule, and the Broadway 
establishments usually have a number of flashily-dressed, vulgar-looking 
men about their doors in the day time, who are insufferably rude to ladies 
passing by.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p723.jpg">
<img alt="THE SKIN GAME." src="images/p723.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Faro is the usual game played at these houses, but it is a very 
different game from that which goes on under the supervision of John 
Chamberlain.&nbsp; In gambler&rsquo;s parlance, it is called a &ldquo;skin 
game.&rdquo;&nbsp; In plain English it means that the bank sets <!-- page 
724--><a name="page724"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 724</span>out to win 
the player&rsquo;s money by deliberate and premeditated fraud.&nbsp; In 
first-class houses a visitor is never urged to play.&nbsp; Here every guest
must stake his money at the risk of encountering personal violence from the
proprietor or his associates.&nbsp; The dealer is well skilled in 
manipulating the cards so as to make them win for the bank always, and 
every effort is made to render the victim hazy with liquor, so that he 
shall not be able to keep a clear record in his mind of the progress of the
game.&nbsp; A common trick is to use sanded cards, or cards with their 
surfaces roughened, so that two, by being handled in a certain way, will 
adhere and fall as one card.&nbsp; Again, the dealer will so arrange his 
cards as to be sure of the exact order in which they will come out.&nbsp; 
He can thus pull out one card, or two at a time, as the &ldquo;necessities 
of the bank&rdquo; may require.&nbsp; Frequently no tally is kept of the 
game, and the player is unable to tell how many turns have been 
made&mdash;whether the full number or less.&nbsp; Even if the fraud is 
discovered, the visitor will find it a serious matter to attempt to expose 
it.&nbsp; The majority of the persons present are in the pay of the bank, 
and all are operating with but one object&mdash;to get possession of the 
money of visitors.&nbsp; The slightest effort at resistance will ensure an 
assault, and the guest is either beaten and thrown into the street, or he 
is robbed and murdered, and his body thrown into the river.&nbsp; There are
always men hanging around these places who are on the watch for an 
opportunity to commit a robbery.&nbsp; The most notorious burglars and 
criminals of the city visit these hells.&nbsp; They keep a close watch over
visitors who stay until the small hours of the morning, especially upon 
those who are under the influence of liquor.&nbsp; They follow them down 
into the dark and silent streets, and, at a favorable moment, spring upon 
them, knock them senseless and rob them.&nbsp; If necessary to ensure their
own safety, they do not hesitate to murder their victims.</p>
<p>Many persons coming to the city yield to the temptation to visit these 
places, merely to see them.&nbsp; They intend to lose only a dollar or two 
as the price of the exhibition.&nbsp; Such men voluntarily seek the danger 
which threatens them.&nbsp; Nine out of ten who go there merely through 
curiosity, lose all their money.&nbsp; <!-- page 725--><a 
name="page725"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 725</span>The men who conduct 
the &ldquo;hell&rdquo; understand how to deal with such cases, and are 
rarely unsuccessful.</p>
<p>It is in these places that clerks and other young men are ruined.&nbsp; 
They lose, and play again, hoping to make good their losses.&nbsp; In this 
way they squander their own means; and too frequently commence to steal 
from their employers, in the vain hope of regaining all they have lost.</p>
<p>There is only one means of safety for all classes&mdash;<i>Keep away 
from the gaming table altogether</i>.</p>
<p>At first gambling was carried on only at night.&nbsp; The fascination of
the game, however, has now become so great, that day gambling houses have 
been opened in the lower part of the city.&nbsp; These are located in 
Broadway, below Fulton street, and in one or two other streets within the 
immediate neighborhood of Wall street.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;houses,&rdquo; as they are called, are really nothing more 
than rooms.&nbsp; They are located on the top floor of a building, the rest
of which is taken up with stores, offices, etc.&nbsp; They are managed on a
plan similar to the night gambling houses, and the windows are all 
carefully closed with wooden shutters, to prevent any sound being heard 
without.&nbsp; The rooms are elegantly furnished, brilliantly lighted with 
gas, and liquors and refreshments are in abundance.&nbsp; As the stairway 
is thronged with persons passing up and down, at all hours of the day, no 
one is noticed in entering the building for the purpose of play.&nbsp; The 
establishment has its &ldquo;runners&rdquo; and &ldquo;ropers in,&rdquo; 
like the night houses, who are paid a percentage on the winnings from their
victims, and the proprietor of the day house is generally the owner of a 
night house higher up town.</p>
<p>Square games are rarely played in these houses.&nbsp; The victim is 
generally fleeced.&nbsp; Men who gamble in stocks, curbstone brokers, and 
others, vainly endeavor to make good a part of their losses at these 
places.&nbsp; They are simply unsuccessful.&nbsp; Clerks, office-boys, and 
others, who can spend but a few minutes and lose only a few dollars at a 
time, are constantly seen in these hells.&nbsp; The aggregate of these 
slight winnings by the bank is very great in the course of the day.&nbsp; 
Pickpockets and <!-- page 726--><a name="page726"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 726</span>thieves are also seen here in considerable 
numbers.&nbsp; They do not come to practise their arts, for they would be 
shown no mercy if they should do so, but come to gamble away their plunder,
or its proceeds.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to speak of the evils of gambling, of the effect of 
the vice upon society.&nbsp; I have merely to describe the practice as it 
prevails here.&nbsp; New York is full of the wrecks it has made.&nbsp; 
Respectable and wealthy families there are by the score whose means have 
been squandered on the green cloth.&nbsp; There are widows and orphans here
whose husbands and fathers have been driven into suicide by gambling 
losses.&nbsp; The State Prisons hold men whose good names have been 
blasted, and whose souls have been stained with crime in consequence of 
this vice.&nbsp; Yet the evil is suffered to grow, and no honest effort is 
made to check it.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; LOTTERIES.</h3>
<p>The lottery business of New York is extensive, and, though conducted in 
violation of the law, those who carry it on make scarcely a show of 
secrecy.</p>
<p>The principal lottery office of the city is located on Broadway, near 
St. Paul&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; It is ostensibly a broker&rsquo;s office, 
and the windows display the usual collection of gold and silver coins, 
bills, drafts, etc.&nbsp; At the rear end of the front room is a door which
leads into the office in which lottery tickets are sold.&nbsp; It is a 
long, narrow apartment, lighted from the ceiling, and so dark that the gas 
is usually kept burning.&nbsp; A high counter extends along two sides of 
the room, and the walls back of this are lined with handbills setting forth
the schemes of the various lotteries.&nbsp; Two large black-boards are 
affixed to the wall back of the main counter, and on these are written the 
numbers as soon as the drawings have been made.&nbsp; There is always a 
crowd of anxious faces in this room at the hour when the drawings are 
received.</p>
<p>The regular lotteries for which tickets are sold here, are the <!-- page
727--><a name="page727"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 727</span>Havana 
Lottery, which is conducted by the Government of the Island of Cuba, the 
Kentucky State Lottery, drawn at Covington, Kentucky, and the Missouri 
State Lottery, drawn at St. Louis, Mo.</p>
<p>The Havana Lottery is managed on the single number plan.&nbsp; There are
26,000 tickets and 739 prizes.&nbsp; The 26,000 tickets are put in the 
wheel, and are drawn out one at a time.&nbsp; At the same time another 
ticket inscribed with the amount of a prize is drawn from another wheel, 
and this prize is accorded to the number drawn from the ticket wheel.&nbsp;
This is continued until the 739 prizes have been disposed of.</p>
<p>The Kentucky and Missouri lotteries are drawn every day at noon, and 
every night.&nbsp; The prizes are neither as large nor as numerous as in 
the Havana lottery.&nbsp; The drawings are made in public, and the numbers 
so drawn are telegraphed all over the country to the agents of the 
lottery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lottery schemes are what is known as the ternary combination 
of seventy-eight numbers, being one to seventy-eight, inclusive; or in 
other words, &lsquo;three number&rsquo; schemes.&nbsp; The numbers vary 
with the day.&nbsp; To-day seventy-eight numbers may be placed in the wheel
and fourteen of them drawn out.&nbsp; Any ticket having on it three of the 
drawn numbers takes a prize, ranging from fifty thousand dollars to three 
hundred dollars, as the scheme may indicate for the day.&nbsp; Tickets with
two of the drawn numbers on them pay an advance of about a hundred per 
cent. of their cost.&nbsp; Tickets with only one of the drawn numbers on 
them get back first cost.&nbsp; On another day only seventy-five numbers 
will be put in the wheel, and only twelve or thirteen drawn out.&nbsp; And 
so it goes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owners or managers of these concerns are prominent sporting 
men and gamblers of New York and elsewhere.&nbsp; Considerable capital is 
invested.&nbsp; It is said that it takes nearly two million dollars to work
this business, and that the profits average five hundred thousand dollars 
or more a year.&nbsp; The ticket sellers get a commission of twelve per 
cent. on all sales.&nbsp; The tickets are issued to them in lots, one set 
of combinations going to one section of the country this week, another 
next; and all <!-- page 728--><a name="page728"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 728</span>tickets unsold up to the hour for the drawing 
at Covington, are sent back to headquarters.&nbsp; In this way many prizes 
are drawn by tickets which remain unsold in dealers&rsquo; hands after they
have reported to the agents; and the lottery makes it clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is argued that lotteries, if managed by honest men, are of necessity 
fair.&nbsp; This is true; but there is a vast amount of questionable 
honesty in the whole management.&nbsp; The numbers may be so manipulated as
to be entirely in favor of the proprietors, and in the fairest lottery the 
chances are always very slim in favor of the exact combination expressed on
any given ticket being drawn from the wheel.&nbsp; The vast majority of 
ticket buyers never receive a cent on their outlay.&nbsp; They simply throw
their money away.&nbsp; Yet all continue their ventures in the hope that 
they may at some time draw a lucky number.&nbsp; The amount annually 
expended in this city in the purchase of lottery tickets is princely.&nbsp;
The amount received in prizes is beggarly.&nbsp; The effect upon the 
lottery gamblers is appalling.&nbsp; Men and women of all ages are simply 
demoralized by it.&nbsp; They neglect their legitimate pursuits, stint 
themselves and their families, commit thefts and forgeries, and are even 
driven into madness and suicide by the hope of growing rich in a day.</p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; POLICY DEALING.</h3>
<p>Policy dealing is closely allied with the lottery business, and is 
carried on by the agents for their own benefit.&nbsp; It is one of the most
dangerous forms of gambling practised in the city.&nbsp; It consists of 
betting on certain numbers, within the range of the lottery schemes, being 
drawn at the noon or evening drawings.&nbsp; You can take any three numbers
of the seventy-eight, and bet, or &ldquo;policy&rdquo; on them.&nbsp; You 
may bet on single numbers, or on combinations.&nbsp; The single number may 
come out anywhere in the drawing.&nbsp; It is called a &ldquo;Day 
Number,&rdquo; and the player deposits one dollar in making his bet.&nbsp; 
If the number is drawn, <!-- page 729--><a name="page729"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 729</span>he wins five dollars.&nbsp; The stake is 
always one dollar, unless a number of bets of the same description are 
taken.&nbsp; Two numbers constitute a &ldquo;Saddle,&rdquo; and both being 
drawn, the player wins from twenty-four dollars to thirty-two 
dollars.&nbsp; Three numbers constitute a &ldquo;Gig,&rdquo; and win $150 
to $225.&nbsp; Four numbers make a &ldquo;Horse,&rdquo; and win $640.&nbsp;
A &ldquo;Capital Saddle&rdquo; is a bet that two numbers will be among the 
first three drawn, and wins $500.&nbsp; A &ldquo;Station Number&rdquo; is a
bet that a given number will come out in a certain place&mdash;for 
instance, that twenty-four will be the tenth number drawn,&mdash;and this 
wins sixty dollars.&nbsp; Any number of &ldquo;Saddles,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Gigs,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Horses,&rdquo; may be taken by a single 
player.</p>
<p>All this seems very simple, and indeed it is so simple that the merest 
child ought to understand it.&nbsp; The policy dealers know that the 
chances are always against a single number being drawn, and still greater 
against the drawing of a combination.&nbsp; Therefore they offer an 
enormous advance upon the amount staked, knowing that they are as sure of 
winning as they could desire to be.&nbsp; A man might play policy for a 
year, and never see his numbers drawn.&nbsp; Yet thousands annually throw 
away large sums in this wretched game.&nbsp; A large share of the earnings 
of the poor go in policy playing.&nbsp; It seems to exercise a terrible 
fascination over its victims.&nbsp; They concentrate all their efforts on 
devising systems and lucky numbers, and continue betting in the vain hope 
that fortune will yet reward them with a lucky &ldquo;gig&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;saddle.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the while they grow poorer, and the policy 
dealers richer.&nbsp; The negroes are most inveterate policy players.&nbsp;
They are firm believers in dreams and dream books.&nbsp; Every dream has 
its corresponding number set down in the books.&nbsp; To dream of a man, is
one; of a woman, five; of both, fifteen; of a colored man, fourteen; of a 
&ldquo;<i>genteel</i> colored man,&rdquo; eleven; and so on.&nbsp; A 
publishing firm in Ann street sells several thousand copies of these dream 
books every month.&nbsp; The negroes are not the only purchasers.&nbsp; 
Even men accounted &ldquo;shrewd&rdquo; in Wall street are among the 
number.&nbsp; Indeed Wall street furnishes some of the most noted policy 
players in the city.</p>
<p><!-- page 730--><a name="page730"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
730</span>The policy offices are generally dingy little holes, and may be 
recognized by the invariable sign, &ldquo;Exchange,&rdquo; over the door or
in the window.&nbsp; They are located principally in the most wretched 
quarters of the city.</p>
<p>Visitors to the Lunatic Asylum and the Almshouse may see a number of 
instances of the fatal results of policy playing.</p>
<h2><!-- page 731--><a name="page731"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
731</span>LXVI.&nbsp; PETER COOPER.</h2>
<p>Peter Cooper was born in New York, on the 12th of February, 1791.&nbsp; 
His maternal grandfather, John Campbell, was Mayor of New York and Deputy 
Quartermaster General during the Revolution, and his father was a 
lieutenant in the Continental army.&nbsp; After the return of peace, 
Lieutenant Cooper resumed his avocation as a hatter, in which he continued 
until his death.&nbsp; It required close attention to business and hard 
work to make a living in those days, and as soon as young Peter was old 
enough to pick the fur from the rabbit skins which were used in making 
hats, he was set to work.&nbsp; He had no opportunity to go to 
school.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never had any time to get an education,&rdquo; 
he once said, &ldquo;and all that I know I have had to pick up as I went 
along.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continued in the hat trade until he had thoroughly 
mastered it, and afterwards became a brewer, pursuing this trade for two 
years, at the end of which time he apprenticed himself to a 
coachmaker.&nbsp; Upon completing his term at this trade, he engaged with 
his brother in the cloth-shearing business, and continued in it until the 
general introduction of foreign cloths, after the War of 1812, made it 
unprofitable.&nbsp; He then became a cabinet maker, but soon after opened a
small grocery store on the present site of the Cooper Institute.</p>
<p>With his savings he purchased a woollen factory, which he conducted 
successfully, and some time after this, enlarged his operations by 
manufacturing glue.&nbsp; In 1830 he erected large iron works at Canton, 
one of the suburbs of Baltimore, and he subsequently carried on extensive 
iron and wire works at Trenton, New Jersey.&nbsp; The greater part of his 
fortune has <!-- page 732--><a name="page732"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
732</span>been gained by the manufacture of iron and glue.&nbsp; He was the
first person to roll wrought iron beams for fire-proof buildings, and soon 
after opening his Baltimore works, he manufactured there, from his own 
designs, the first locomotive ever made in America.&nbsp; He has been 
interested in various enterprises, the majority of which have proved 
successful, and has shown a remarkable capacity for conducting a number of 
entirely different undertakings at the same time.&nbsp; He is now very 
wealthy, and has made every dollar of his fortune by his own unaided 
exertions.&nbsp; He resides in a handsome mansion in Grammercy Park, but 
lives simply and without ostentation.</p>
<p>He does not enjoy the marked respect and popularity of which he never 
fails to receive hearty evidences when he appears in public, because of his
success alone.&nbsp; He is one of the principal benefactors of the city, 
and has placed the whole community under heavy obligations to him by his 
noble gift to the public of the Cooper Institute, which institution has 
been described in another chapter.</p>
<p>He conceived the idea of this institution more than forty years ago, and
long before he was able to carry it out.&nbsp; Having been much impressed 
with a description of the <i>&Eacute;coles d&rsquo;Industrie</i> of Paris, 
he was resolved that his native city should have at least one similar 
institution.&nbsp; As soon as he felt able to do so, he began the erection 
of the Cooper Institute.&nbsp; The entire cost was borne by him, and the 
actual outlay exceeded the estimate upon which he had begun the work by 
nearly thirty thousand dollars.&nbsp; He had many obstacles, mechanical, as
well as pecuniary, to overcome, and when the building was completed and 
paid for, he found himself comparatively a poor man.&nbsp; Almost every 
dollar of his fortune had been expended upon his great gift to the working 
men and women of New York.&nbsp; He persevered, however, and his Institute 
began the career of usefulness which it has since pursued.</p>
<p>Since then he has prospered to a greater extent than ever, and has 
acquired a large fortune.&nbsp; He has taken an active part in the 
extension of the telegraph interests of the country, and is now a 
stockholder and an officer in the Atlantic Cable <!-- page 733--><a 
name="page733"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 733</span>Companies.&nbsp; He 
is very popular among all classes of citizens, and his appearance at public
meetings is always greeted with applause.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper is of medium height, and is rather thin in person.&nbsp; He 
has a profusion of silvery white hair, and wears his beard under his chin, 
with the lip and chin clean shaven.&nbsp; His large gold spectacles give a 
peculiar expression to his eyes, which are small and gray.&nbsp; His face 
is sharp and thin, and very intelligent, and one of the most thoroughly 
amiable and benevolent countenances to be met with in New York.&nbsp; It is
emphatically the face of a good man.</p>
<h2><!-- page 734--><a name="page734"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
734</span>LXVII.&nbsp; THE &ldquo;HEATHEN CHINEE.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>According to the Census of 1870, there were twenty-three Chinese 
inhabitants of New York, but the actual number of Celestials in the city at
present is believed to be about seventy-five.&nbsp; The most of these are 
very poor, and nearly all reside in the Five Points district, generally in 
Baxter street.&nbsp; Some of them are wretched and depraved, but the 
majority are industrious and well behaved.</p>
<p>The Chinese candy and cigar sellers are well known.&nbsp; They stand on 
the street corners, by little wooden tables covered with broken bits of 
candy, which they sell at a penny a piece.&nbsp; They are dirty, dull, and 
hopeless looking.&nbsp; No one ever sees them smile, and they rarely pay 
any attention to what is passing on the street.&nbsp; Of all the dwellers 
in the great city they seem the most utterly forlorn.&nbsp; The patience 
with which they remain at their posts, day after day, and in all weathers, 
is touching, and one cannot help pitying them.&nbsp; Their earnings must be
very small, but they manage to live on them.</p>
<p>The cigar makers are more fortunate.&nbsp; They buy cheap remnants of 
tobacco from the dealers in that article, and at night make these lots up 
into cigars, averaging from 150 to 180 cigars per night.&nbsp; They dispose
of these the next day at three cents apiece, and some of them earn as much 
as $30 or $35 per week.&nbsp; The cigar maker has a peculiar song which he 
sings or chants while rolling out his cigars, and varies this chant by 
occasionally puffing a cigar.</p>
<p>There are scarcely any Chinese women in the city, but nearly all the 
Chinamen are married.&nbsp; They have a great fondness for Irish wives, and
nearly all have two, and some of them three <!-- page 735--><a 
name="page735"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 735</span>wives apiece.&nbsp; 
Families of this size are very expensive luxuries, and it takes all 
John&rsquo;s industry to provide for them.&nbsp; A gentleman not long since
asked one of these much married individuals how he managed to keep his 
wives from fighting.&nbsp; He was answered that they got along very 
peaceably together.&nbsp; Upon being pressed, however, John admitted that 
they did fight sometimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you manage them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he fightee,&rdquo; said John, dryly, &ldquo;me turnee him 
out in the yardee.&nbsp; Me lockee the door, and let him fightee out.&nbsp;
He git tired soon, and me let him in.&nbsp; Me&mdash;what you call 
him?&mdash;boss here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children by these queer unions seem to be healthy, and nearly all of
them speak Chinese in talking to their fathers, and their English has a 
decided brogue.&nbsp; Many of the Chinese decorate their houses with the 
letters they have received from home.&nbsp; These letters are curious 
collections of hieroglyphics, some of which are executed in brilliant 
colors.</p>
<p>There is a Chinese boarding house for sailors of that nationality in 
Baxter street, kept by a Chinaman and his wife, who is also an 
Oriental.&nbsp; These Chinese sailors are simply cooks or stewards of 
vessels arriving here from China or California, and not able-bodied 
seamen.&nbsp; They do not frequent the ordinary sailor&rsquo;s boarding 
houses, and are never seen in the dance houses or hells of Water 
street.&nbsp; They pass their time on shore quietly in their 
countryman&rsquo;s establishment, and some of them use this season of 
leisure in trying to acquaint themselves with the English language.&nbsp; 
All are opium smokers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p736.jpg">
<img alt="CHINESE CANDY DEALER." src="images/p736.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The main room of the boarding house in Baxter street is fitted up with a
series of beds or berths, one above another, extending around it.&nbsp; At 
almost any time one may find several Chinese lying in these berths smoking 
opium.&nbsp; The opium pipe is a large piece of wood pierced down the 
centre with a fine hole.&nbsp; The stem is very thick, and is about 
eighteen inches long.&nbsp; The smoker has before him a box of soft gum 
opium and a small lamp.&nbsp; He takes a little steel rod, picks off a 
small piece of opium with it, holds it in the flame of the lamp for a few 
<!-- page 737--><a name="page737"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
737</span>minutes, and when it has become thoroughly ignited, places it in 
the bowl of his pipe and puffs away, repeating the operation until he is 
satisfied, or is insensible.</p>
<p>They are very fond of cards.&nbsp; Those used by them are brought from 
China, and are curiosities.&nbsp; They are about one inch in width and five
inches long, and are gorgeously painted with old time Chinese men and 
women.&nbsp; To each card there is attached a certain value.&nbsp; The 
cards are divided into six lots of equal size.&nbsp; Each of the two 
players chooses one of these packs alternately.&nbsp; The first player 
places a card on the table, and his opponent places another immediately 
across it.&nbsp; The others are placed obliquely to these, in the form of a
star, and each player scores the value of his card as he lays it 
down.&nbsp; The game is won by the player who has the largest score.</p>
<p>Altogether, in spite of the misconduct of a few, the Chinese of New York
are, barring their bigamous affection for the Irish women, a very innocent 
and well-behaved class.</p>
<h2><!-- page 738--><a name="page738"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
738</span>LXVIII.&nbsp; STREET CHILDREN.</h2>
<p>In spite of the labors of the Missions and the Reformatory Institutions,
there are ten thousand children living on the streets of New York, gaining 
their bread by blacking boots, by selling newspapers, watches, pins, etc., 
and by stealing.&nbsp; Some are thrust into the streets by dissolute 
parents, some are orphans, some are voluntary outcasts, and others drift 
here from the surrounding country.&nbsp; Wherever they may come from, or 
however they may get here, they are here, and they are nearly all leading a
vagrant life which will ripen into crime or pauperism.</p>
<p>The newsboys constitute an important division of this army of homeless 
children.&nbsp; You see them everywhere, in all parts of the city, but they
are most numerous in and about Printing House Square, near the offices of 
the great dailies.&nbsp; They rend the air and deafen you with their shrill
cries.&nbsp; They surround you on the sidewalk, and almost force you to buy
their papers.&nbsp; They climb up the steps of the stage, thrust their grim
little faces into the windows, and bring nervous passengers to their feet 
with their shrill yells; or, scrambling into a street car, at the risk of 
being kicked into the street by a brutal conductor, they will offer you 
their papers in such an earnest, appealing way, that, nine times out of 
ten, you buy from sheer pity for the child.</p>
<p>The boys who sell the morning papers are very few in number.&nbsp; The 
newspaper stands seem to have the whole monopoly of this branch of the 
trade, and the efforts of the newsboys are confined to the afternoon 
journals&mdash;especially the cheap ones&mdash;some of which, however, are 
dear bargains at a penny.&nbsp; They swarm around the City Hall, and in the
eastern section of the <!-- page 739--><a name="page739"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 739</span>city, below Canal street; and in the former 
locality, half a dozen will sometimes surround a luckless pedestrian, 
thrusting their wares in his face, and literally forcing him to buy one to 
get rid of them.&nbsp; The moment he shows the least disposition to yield, 
they commence fighting among themselves for the &ldquo;honor&rdquo; of 
serving him.&nbsp; They are ragged and dirty.&nbsp; Some have no coats, no 
shoes, and no hat.&nbsp; Some are simply stupid, others are bright, 
intelligent little fellows, who would make good and useful men if they 
could have a chance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p739.jpg">
<img alt="THE NEWSBOYS." src="images/p739.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The majority of these boys live at home, but many of them are wanderers 
in the streets, selling papers at times, and begging at others.&nbsp; Some 
pay their earnings, which rarely amount to more than thirty cents per day, 
to their mothers&mdash;others spend them in tobacco, strong drink, and in 
visiting the low-class theatres and concert halls.</p>
<p>Formerly, these little fellows suffered very much from exposure and 
hunger.&nbsp; In the cold nights of winter, they slept on the stairways of 
the newspaper offices, in old boxes or barrels, under door steps, and 
sometimes sought a &ldquo;warm bed&rdquo; on the street gratings of the 
printing offices, where the warm steam from the vaults below could pass 
over them.</p>
<p><!-- page 740--><a name="page740"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
740</span>The Bootblacks rank next to the newsboys.&nbsp; They are 
generally older; being from ten to sixteen years of age.&nbsp; Some are 
both newsboys and bootblacks, carrying on these pursuits at different hours
of the day.</p>
<p>They provide themselves with the usual bootblack&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;kit,&rdquo; of box and brushes.&nbsp; They are sharp, quick-witted 
boys, with any number of bad habits, and are always ready to fall into 
criminal practices when enticed into them by older hands.&nbsp; Burglars 
make constant use of them to enter dwellings and stores and open the doors 
from the inside.&nbsp; Sometimes these little fellows undertake burglaries 
on their own account, but they are generally caught by the police.</p>
<p>The bootblacks are said to form a regular confraternity, with fixed 
laws.&nbsp; They are said to have a &ldquo;captain,&rdquo; who is the chief
of the order, and to pay an initiation fee of from two dollars 
downwards.&nbsp; This money is said to find its way to the pockets of the 
captain, whose duty it is to &ldquo;punch the head&rdquo; of any member 
violating the rules of the society.&nbsp; The society fixes the price of 
blacking a pair of boots or shoes at ten cents, and severely punishes those
who work for a less sum.&nbsp; They are at liberty, however, to receive any
sum that may be given them in excess of this price.&nbsp; They surround 
their calling with a great deal of mystery, and those who profess to be 
members of the society flatly refuse to communicate anything concerning its
place of meeting, or its transactions.</p>
<p>A large part of the earnings of the bootblacks is spent for tobacco and 
liquors.&nbsp; These children are regular patrons of the Bowery Theatre and
the low-class concert halls.&nbsp; Their course of life leads to miserable 
results.&nbsp; Upon reaching the age of seventeen or eighteen the bootblack
generally abandons his calling, and as he is unfit for any other employment
by reason of his laziness and want of skill, be becomes a loafer, a bummer,
or a criminal.</p>
<p>For the purpose of helping these and other outcasts, the 
Children&rsquo;s Aid Society was organized nineteen years ago.&nbsp; Since 
then it has labored actively among them, and has saved many from their 
wretched lives, and has enabled them to become respectable and useful 
members of society.</p>
<p><!-- page 741--><a name="page741"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
741</span>The Children&rsquo;s Aid Society extends its labors to every 
class of poor and needy children that can be reached, but makes the street 
children the especial objects of its care.&nbsp; It conducts five lodging 
houses, in which shelter and food are furnished at nominal prices to boys 
and girls, and carries on nineteen day and eleven evening Industrial 
Schools in various parts of the city.&nbsp; The success of the society is 
greatly, if not chiefly, due to the labors and management of Charles Loring
Brace, its secretary, who has been the good genius of the New York street 
children for nearly twenty years.</p>
<p>The best known, and one of the most interesting establishments of the 
Children&rsquo;s Aid Society, is the <i>Newsboys&rsquo; Lodging House</i>, 
in Park Place, near Broadway.&nbsp; It was organized in March, 1854, and, 
after many hard struggles, has now reached a position of assured 
success.&nbsp; It is not a charity in any sense that could offend the 
self-respect and independence of its inmates.&nbsp; Indeed, it relies for 
its success mainly in cultivating these qualities in them.&nbsp; It is in 
charge of Mr. Charles O&rsquo;Connor, who is assisted in its management by 
his wife.&nbsp; Its hospitality is not confined to newsboys.&nbsp; 
Bootblacks, street venders, and juvenile vagrants of all kinds are 
welcomed, and every effort is made to induce them to come regularly that 
they may profit by the influences and instruction of the house.&nbsp; Boys 
pay five cents for supper (and they get an excellent meal), five cents for 
lodging, and five cents for breakfast.&nbsp; Those who are found unable to 
pay are given shelter and food without charge, and if they are willing to 
work for themselves are assisted in doing so.</p>
<p>The boys come in toward nightfall, in time for supper, which is served 
between six and seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Many, however, do not come until
after the theatres close.&nbsp; If they are strangers, their names and a 
description of them are recorded in the register.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boys have 
come in,&rdquo; says Mr. Brace, &ldquo;who did not know their own 
names.&nbsp; They are generally known to one another by slang names, such 
as the following: &lsquo;Mickety,&rsquo; &lsquo;Round Hearts,&rsquo; 
&lsquo;Horace Greeley,&rsquo; &lsquo;Wandering Jew,&rsquo; &lsquo;Fat 
Jack,&rsquo; &lsquo;Pickle Nose,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cranky Jim,&rsquo; 
&lsquo;Dodge-me-John,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tickle-me-foot,&rsquo; 
&lsquo;Know-Nothing Mike,&rsquo; &lsquo;O&rsquo;Neill the Great,&rsquo; 
&lsquo;Professor,&rsquo; and innumerable others.&nbsp; They have also a 
slang dialect.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 742--><a name="page742"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
742</span>Upon being registered, the boy deposits his cap, overcoat, if he 
has one, comforter, boots, &ldquo;kit,&rdquo; or other impedimenta, in a 
closet, of which there are a number, for safe keeping.&nbsp; He passes then
to the bath tub, where he receives a good scrubbing.&nbsp; His hair is 
combed, and if he is in need of clothing, he receives it from a stock of 
second hand garments given by charitable individuals for the use of the 
society.&nbsp; Supper is then served, after which the boys assemble in the 
class room, which is also the chapel.&nbsp; Here they engage in study, or 
are entertained by lectures or addresses from visitors.&nbsp; They also 
sing hymns and familiar songs, and the sitting usually terminates about 
nine o&rsquo;clock with the recitation of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the 
singing of the Doxology.&nbsp; After this they may go to bed, or play 
dominoes for an hour or two longer, or repair to the gymnasium.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening divine service is held in the chapel.&nbsp; Says Mr. 
Brace: &ldquo;There is something unspeakably solemn and affecting in the 
crowded and attentive meetings of these boys, of a Sunday evening, and in 
the thought that you speak for a few minutes on the high themes of eternity
to a young audience who to-morrow will be battling with misery, temptation,
and sin in every shape and form, and to whom your words may be the last 
they ever hear of either friendly sympathy or warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The effect on the boys,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;of this constant, 
patient, religious instruction, we know to have been most happy.&nbsp; Some
have acknowledged it, living, and have shown better lives.&nbsp; Others 
have spoken of it in the hospitals and on their death-beds, or have written
their gratitude from the battle field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers of the Lodging House use their influence to induce the 
boys, who are the most notoriously improvident creatures in the city, to 
save their earnings.&nbsp; They have met with considerable success.&nbsp; 
There is now a Newsboys&rsquo; Savings Bank, which began in this way: A 
former superintendent, Mr. Tracy, caused a large table to be provided and 
placed in the Lodging House.&nbsp; This table contained &ldquo;a drawer 
divided into <!-- page 743--><a name="page743"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
743</span>separate compartments, each with a slit in the lid, into which 
the boys dropped their pennies, each box being numbered and reserved for a 
depositor.&nbsp; The drawer was carefully locked, and, after an experience 
of one or two forays on it from petty thieves who crept in with the others,
it was fastened to the floor, and the under part lined with tin.&nbsp; The 
Superintendent called the lads together, told them the object of the Bank, 
which was to make them save their money, and put it to vote how long it 
should be kept locked.&nbsp; They voted for two months, and thus, for all 
this time, the depositors could not get at their savings.&nbsp; Some 
repented, and wanted their money, but the rule was rigid.&nbsp; At the end 
of the period, the Bank was opened in the presence of all the lodgers, with
much ceremony, and the separate deposits were made known, amid an immense 
deal of &lsquo;chaffing&rsquo; from one another.&nbsp; The depositors were 
amazed at the amount of their savings; the increase seemed to awaken in 
them the instinct of property, and they at once determined to deposit the 
amounts in the city savings banks, or to buy clothes with them.&nbsp; Very 
little was spent foolishly.&nbsp; This simple contrivance has done more to 
break up the gambling and extravagant habits of the class than any other 
one influence.&nbsp; The Superintendent now pays a large interest on 
deposits, and the Trustees have offered prizes to the lads who save the 
most.&rdquo;&nbsp; The deposits of the boys now foot up an aggregate of 
about $1800.</p>
<p>The boys are assisted to earn their own support.&nbsp; Says Mr. Brace, 
writing in 1870:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the liberality of one of our warmest friends, and 
generous trustee, B. J. Howland, Esq., a fund, which we call the 
&lsquo;Howland Fund,&rsquo; was established.&nbsp; He contributed $10, to 
which other patrons added their contributions subsequently.&nbsp; The 
object of this fund is to aid poor and needy boys, and supply them with the
means to start in business.&nbsp; We have loaned from this fund during the 
year $155.66, on which the borrowers have realized a profit of 
$381.42.&nbsp; It will be seen that they made a profit of 246 per 
cent.&nbsp; We loan it in sums of 5 cents and upward; in many cases it has 
been returned in a few hours.&nbsp; At the date of our last report there 
was due and <!-- page 744--><a name="page744"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
744</span>outstanding of this fund $11.05, of which $5 has since been paid,
leaving $6.05 unpaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work of the Lodging House for seventeen years is thus summed up by 
the same authority:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lodging House has existed seventeen years.&nbsp; During that 
time we have lodged 82,519 different boys, restored 6178 lost and missing 
boys to their friends, provided 6008 with homes and employment, furnished 
523,488 lodgings, and 373,366 meals.&nbsp; The expense of all this has been
$109,325.26, of which amount the boys have contributed $28,956.67, leaving 
actual expenses over and above the receipts from the boys $80,368.59, being
about $1 to each boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other institutions of the Children&rsquo;s Aid Society are conducted
with similar liberality and success.&nbsp; We have not the space to devote 
to them here, and pass them by with regret.</p>
<p>It is not claimed that the Society has revolutionized the character of 
the street children of New York.&nbsp; It will never do that.&nbsp; But it 
has saved many of them from sin and vagrancy, and has put them in paths of 
respectability and virtue.&nbsp; It has done a great work among them, and 
it deserves to be encouraged by all.&nbsp; It is sadly in need of funds 
during the present winter, and will at all times make the best use of 
moneys contributed towards its support.</p>
<p>It employs an agent to conduct its children to homes in other parts of 
the country, principally in the West, as soon as it is deemed expedient to 
send them away from its institutions.&nbsp; It takes care that all so 
placed in homes are also placed under proper Christian influences.</p>
<h2><!-- page 745--><a name="page745"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
745</span>LXIX.&nbsp; SWINDLERS.</h2>
<p>There are a large number of persons in New York who make considerable 
sums of money by conducting &ldquo;Gift Enterprises,&rdquo; and similar 
schemes.&nbsp; These usually open an office in some prominent part of the 
city, and flood the country with circulars and handbills of their 
schemes.&nbsp; They sometimes advertise that the affair is for the benefit 
of some school, or library, or charitable association.&nbsp; In a few 
instances they announce that the scheme is merely a means of disposing 
quickly of an extensive estate, or a building.&nbsp; Whatever may be the 
pretext, the object is always to wring money out of the credulous, and the 
plan is substantially the same.&nbsp; Generally, in order to evade the law 
against lotteries, a concert is announced, and the tickets are sold 
ostensibly as admissions to that amusement.&nbsp; Buyers are told that the 
result will be announced at this concert.&nbsp; The tickets are sold at 
prices varying from one to five dollars.&nbsp; Directories of other cities 
are obtained, and the mailing clerks of the city newspapers are paid for 
copies of the subscription lists of those journals.&nbsp; Circulars are 
mailed to parties in other parts of the country, whose names are thus 
obtained.&nbsp; There is scarcely a town or village in the United States 
but is reached in this way, and as there are many simpletons in every 
community, responses of the character desired by the swindlers come in 
rapidly.&nbsp; Each person to whom a circular is sent is requested to act 
as an agent for the scheme, and is promised a prize in the distribution if 
he will use his influence to sell tickets, and he is requested to say 
nothing of the inducements offered to him, as such knowledge would make 
others dissatisfied.&nbsp; The prize is represented as of great 
value.&nbsp; The person receiving the circular is usually <!-- page 
746--><a name="page746"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 746</span>flattered by
being selected as the agent of a New York house, and is also tempted by the
liberal offer made to him.&nbsp; He sets to work at once, sells a number of
tickets, and forwards the proceeds to his principals in New York.&nbsp; The
money is simply thrown away.&nbsp; No concert is ever held, no drawing is 
ever made.&nbsp; The scoundrels in charge of the swindle continue the sale 
as long as there is a demand for the tickets, and pocket all the 
receipts.&nbsp; When there is danger of interference by the police, they 
close their office and disappear.&nbsp; In a short while, they resume 
operations under a new name with an entirely new scheme, and repeat the 
same trick from year to year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p746.jpg">
<img alt="ATTACK ON A SWINDLER." src="images/p746.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The police are constantly called upon to break up these affairs.&nbsp; 
Not long ago, a well-known Gift Enterprise manager <!-- page 747--><a 
name="page747"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 747</span>was brought before 
the Tombs Police Court upon the complaint of several of his victims.&nbsp; 
The plaintiffs were unable, however, to make out a successful case against 
him, and he was discharged.&nbsp; His victims&mdash;the court room was 
crowded with them&mdash;then resolved to be their own avengers, and as he 
came out into the street radiant with triumph, they fell upon him, and but 
for the interference of the police would have beaten him severely.</p>
<p>A few months ago, a Gift Enterprise establishment was opened in 
Broadway, not far from the Grand Central Hotel.&nbsp; The plan was as 
follows: A large stock of jewelry, pianos, fancy articles, musical 
instruments, etc., all of which were subsequently proved to have been hired
for the purpose, was displayed in a large store in Broadway.&nbsp; 
Purchasers, attracted by the handsome stock, and the announcement that it 
would be disposed of by a &ldquo;grand drawing,&rdquo; were induced to 
purchase sealed envelopes from the clerks, at one dollar each.&nbsp; Each 
envelope contained a check on which was a printed number.&nbsp; Purchasers,
after buying these checks and ascertaining the numbers, were requested to 
pass down into the basement.&nbsp; Here a large wheel, turned by a man, was
constantly revolving.&nbsp; The purchaser presented his check, and a clerk 
thrust his hand into the wheel and drew out a small slip of 
pasteboard.&nbsp; If the number thus drawn corresponded with the number of 
the check held by the purchaser, the purchaser was entitled to the article 
the name of which was affixed to the said number, on a printed list of the 
contents of the store.&nbsp; The scheme was seemingly fair enough, but the 
majority of the tickets drew blanks.&nbsp; Occasionally, however, when the 
sales began to show signs of slackening, a lucky number would draw a watch,
a diamond pin, or a piano, and the article would be formally delivered to 
the holder of the ticket.&nbsp; Immediately the crowd which filled the 
store would invest anew in tickets, but nothing but blanks would reward 
them.</p>
<p>The captain of police, commanding the precinct in which the affair was 
conducted, became interested in the scheme.&nbsp; His quick eye detected 
many irregularities in the transaction, and he saw that the holders of the 
lucky numbers were always the same men, and that they at once passed into a
back room of the <!-- page 748--><a name="page748"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 748</span>establishment.&nbsp; Convinced that the 
purchasers were being swindled, he attired himself in plain clothes, 
purchased a ticket, went down to the basement, and drew a blank.&nbsp; 
Taking his stand by the wheel, he watched the drawing of sixty-five tickets
in succession.&nbsp; Each drew a blank.&nbsp; Thoroughly satisfied of the 
fraud, he procured a warrant for the arrest of the manager of the scheme, 
and seized the establishment.&nbsp; The wheel was found to contain about a 
bushel of bits of pasteboard, every one of which was blank.&nbsp; Efforts 
were made to punish the parties connected with the swindle, but without 
success.</p>
<p>Another trick of the New York swindlers is to send a circular to someone
in a distant town, notifying him that he has drawn a prize in their 
lottery, say a watch worth two hundred dollars.&nbsp; They state that he 
must forward five per cent. (ten dollars) on the valuation of the watch 
within ten days.&nbsp; The person receiving this circular well knows that 
he has purchased no ticket in the above concern, and at once supposes that 
he has received through mistake the notification intended for some other 
man.&nbsp; Still, as the parties offer to send him, for ten dollars, a 
watch worth two hundred dollars, he cannot resist the temptation to close 
with the bargain at once.&nbsp; He sends his ten dollars, and never hears 
of it again.&nbsp; These circulars are sent out by the thousand to all 
parts of the country, and, strange as it may seem, the trick is successful 
in the majority of instances.</p>
<p>The scoundrels who carry on these enterprises feel perfectly safe.&nbsp;
They know that their victims dare not prosecute them, as by purchasing a 
ticket a man becomes a party to the transaction, and violates the laws of 
the State of New York.&nbsp; No one cares to avow himself a party to any 
such transaction, and consequently the swindlers are safe from 
prosecution.</p>
<p>The Post-office authorities of the city state that over five hundred 
letters per day are received in this city from various parts of the 
country, addressed to the principal gift establishments of the city.&nbsp; 
Nearly all of these letters contain various sums of money.&nbsp; Last 
winter these mails were seized and opened by the Post-office Department, 
and some of the letters were found to contain as much as three hundred 
dollars.</p>
<p><!-- page 749--><a name="page749"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
749</span>The profits of these swindlers are enormous.&nbsp; Those which 
are well conducted realize half a million of dollars in three or four 
months.&nbsp; Instead of resting satisfied with this amount, the rogues 
close up their business, and start a fresh enterprise.</p>
<p>From this description the reader will see how the various gift 
enterprises, under whatever name they are presented, are managed, and how 
certain he is to lose every cent he invests in them.&nbsp; The description 
applies also to the various Manufacturing and Co-operative Jewelry 
Associations, and all schemes of a kindred nature.</p>
<p>A little common sense ought to teach persons that no man can afford to 
sell a watch worth one hundred dollars for five dollars, or a diamond pin 
worth two hundred dollars for one dollar.&nbsp; And yet thousands 
innocently believe the assertions of the swindlers, and part with their 
money never to see it again.&nbsp; The gold pens, jewelry, watches, etc., 
sold by these advertising swindlers are not worth a twentieth of the cost 
of the tickets.</p>
<p>The Dollar stores reap enormous profits from the sale of their bogus 
jewelry, etc.&nbsp; They ask a dollar for an article which is dear at 
twenty-five cents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Situation Agencies&rdquo; are common in the city.&nbsp; There are
always a number of people here out of employment and anxious to obtain 
it.&nbsp; These are attracted by advertisements such as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WANTED, CLERKS, COPYISTS, COLLECTORS, timekeepers, watchmen, porters, 
bartenders, coachmen, grooms, two valets to travel.&nbsp; Immediate 
employment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They call at the &ldquo;Agency,&rdquo; which is usually in one of the 
upper stories of a Nassau street building.&nbsp; The agent, a flashy young 
man, personates his clerk on such occasions.&nbsp; He informs the applicant
that the proprietor is not in, but will be soon, and that in order to 
secure the very first chance of employment, he must register his name and 
make a deposit of two dollars.&nbsp; He overcomes the objections of the 
applicant by stating that the office is overrun with persons needing 
assistants, and that there <!-- page 750--><a name="page750"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 750</span>are a dozen openings ready for the 
applicant.&nbsp; The proprietor, however, manages all these things 
himself.&nbsp; He is sure to be in in the afternoon.&nbsp; The name is 
registered, the money is paid, but the proprietor is never to be 
found.&nbsp; The &ldquo;clerk,&rdquo; if pressed for the return of the 
money, utterly denies the whole transaction, destroys the register, if 
necessary, and as there is no evidence to convict him, he escapes the 
punishment of his crime.</p>
<p>Another &ldquo;circular swindle&rdquo; is practised as follows: 
Circulars are sent to persons in other parts of the Union, offering one 
hundred dollars in perfect counterfeits of United States Treasury notes and
fractional currency for five dollars.&nbsp; One of the most ingenious of 
these circulars, all of which are lithographed, reads as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Congress authorized the present issue of greenbacks, the 
Treasury Department executed plates of enormous cost and wonderful 
workmanship, from which the whole amount of currency authorized by Congress
was to be printed, and it was ordered at the time, that, as soon as the 
whole amount had been printed, the plates, some one hundred in number, 
should be taken from the Treasury Department, conveyed to the Navy Yard, 
and melted.&nbsp; Now, it so happened that the plates from which the one, 
two, and five dollar bills had been printed, were not destroyed.&nbsp; How 
it was brought about, we, as a matter of prudence, do not state.&nbsp; It 
is enough to know that the plates are still preserved uninjured, and we 
trust their whereabouts will never be known, except to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Formerly this business was carried on through the Post-office, the 
rascals sending their victims the photographic cards of the currency of the
United States, which sell on the streets for a penny or two apiece.&nbsp; 
The Government, however, suddenly put a stop to this by seizing the letters
addressed to the swindlers, and returning them, with the money enclosed, to
the writers.&nbsp; Now the knaves are careful to caution their 
correspondents to send money by express, and to prepay the charges.&nbsp; 
Very many of these circulars are successful.&nbsp; The money is sent in 
advance, or the &ldquo;queer&rdquo; is shipped C.O.D.&nbsp; In the latter 
<!-- page 751--><a name="page751"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
751</span>case, the box is delivered on payment of the charges, and the 
money thus secured to the swindler, as it is the plain duty of the express 
company to forward it to the sender of the C.O.D.&nbsp; The box, upon being
opened by the victim, is found to contain old paper, or bits of iron or 
stone.</p>
<p>As a matter of course, only dishonest men will answer these circulars, 
or consent to buy money known to be counterfeit.&nbsp; The world is full of
such, however, and large sums are annually received by the New York 
swindlers in answer to their circulars.&nbsp; The victim, in the majority 
of instances, is afraid to expose the trick.&nbsp; The police of the city 
are fully informed as to the names, appearance, and residence, of each of 
these swindlers, but are powerless to interfere with them.&nbsp; They do 
not issue counterfeit money, and are not, therefore, liable to the charge 
of counterfeiting.&nbsp; They screen themselves from the charge of 
obtaining money under false pretences by never transacting their business 
in person.&nbsp; Everything is done by letter, and even the C.O.D. part of 
the business is managed in such a way as to make identification 
impossible.</p>
<p>The country newspapers are filled with advertisements of cheap sewing 
machines, which range in price from one to ten dollars.&nbsp; The men who 
insert these advertisements are among the most unprincipled swindlers in 
New York.&nbsp; Sometimes they pocket the money and send nothing in return,
but when they do send a &ldquo;machine&rdquo; it is worthless.&nbsp; The 
actual cost of it never exceeds twenty-five cents.&nbsp; One scoundrel, 
some time ago, sent a lady who had remitted him three dollars a large 
needle, and wrote that it was &ldquo;the best sewing machine in the 
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another swindler advertises a music box for $2.50, &ldquo;warranted to 
play six airs.&rdquo;&nbsp; In return for the money, he sends a 
child&rsquo;s harmonicon, the retail price of which is fifty cents.</p>
<p>Another advertises a &ldquo;Pocket Time-keeper,&rdquo; at one 
dollar.&nbsp; It is usually a wretched pasteboard, tin or brass imitation 
of a sun dial.&nbsp; Sometimes it is a child&rsquo;s toy watch.</p>
<p>The day of mock auctions has gone by, but there are still one or two of 
these establishments lingering in the city.&nbsp; These are managed in 
various ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 752--><a name="page752"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 752</span>
<a href="images/p752.jpg">
<img alt="A STRANGER&rsquo;S EXIT FROM A &ldquo;CHEAP JOHN SHOP&rdquo;." 
src="images/p752.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At some of these establishments a lot of pencil cases, watches, or other
goods, is offered for sale.&nbsp; The lot generally contains a dozen or a 
gross of articles.&nbsp; Bids are started by the &ldquo;decoys&rdquo; of 
the proprietor, who are scattered through the crowd, and strangers are thus
induced to make offers for them.&nbsp; Each man supposes he is bidding for 
a single lot, and is greatly astonished <!-- page 753--><a 
name="page753"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 753</span>to find the whole lot
knocked down to him.&nbsp; He is told he must take the entire lot, that his
bid was for all.&nbsp; Some are weak enough to comply with the demand, but 
others resist it.</p>
<p>A well-known Broadway auctioneer was brought before the Mayor, some time
ago, on the following complaint.&nbsp; A gentleman, who appeared against 
the auctioneer, stated that he had attended his last sale.&nbsp; The 
auctioneer put up a box containing twelve silver pencil-cases, and the 
gentleman, supposing from his manner and language, that he was selling them
fairly, bid two dollars and fifty cents for the lot.&nbsp; To his surprise,
he was told that he had bid two dollars and fifty cents for <i>each</i> 
pencil-case, and that he must pay thirty dollars for the whole lot.&nbsp; 
The money had been paid and the auctioneer refused to return it, insisting 
that the gentleman should take one pencil-case or nothing.&nbsp; The Mayor 
compelled the scamp to refund the money, and warned him that he would 
revoke his licence if a similar complaint were again made against him.</p>
<p>In some of these establishments, a stranger who attempts to remonstrate 
against the swindle fares badly.&nbsp; He is hustled out by the 
confederates of the proprietor, and if he attempts to defend himself, is 
handed over to the police on a charge of attempting to create a 
disturbance.</p>
<p>Other establishments sell watches and cheap jewelry.&nbsp; A really good
article is put up, and passed around through the crowd as a sample.&nbsp; 
It draws bids rapidly, and is knocked down to the highest bidder.&nbsp; It 
has by this time been handed back to the auctioneer, and when the purchaser
demands it, he is given some worthless article, which the dealer and his 
assistants swear was the one exhibited to the crowd.&nbsp; Remonstrances 
are useless.&nbsp; The bogus article must be taken or the money lost, 
unless the victim calls in the police.&nbsp; The city authorities have 
recently stationed a policeman at the door of one of these establishments, 
to warn strangers of its true character.</p>
<p>The pocket-book dropping game is of common occurrence, but is rarely 
practised on residents of the city.&nbsp; A man suddenly darts from a crowd
on the street and appears to pick up something at the feet of his intended 
victim.&nbsp; This, of course, attracts <!-- page 754--><a 
name="page754"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 754</span>the attention of the 
latter.&nbsp; The former displays a well-filled pocket-book, and asks the 
stranger if he dropped it, as it was found at his feet.&nbsp; He is 
answered in the negative.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p754.jpg">
<img alt="THE POCKET-BOOK GAME." src="images/p754.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; remarks the swindler, &ldquo;it was lying right 
at your feet, and I felt sure it was yours.&nbsp; However, it is a rich 
prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then inquires if the stranger intends staying in town.&nbsp; If 
answered affirmatively, he says:</p>
<p><!-- page 755--><a name="page755"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
755</span>&ldquo;Then I will turn over the pocket-book to you.&nbsp; You 
can advertise it.&nbsp; Give me ten dollars and take the wallet.&nbsp; You 
can advertise it, or the owner will no doubt advertise it himself.&nbsp; 
Then you can claim the reward, which will certainly not be less than fifty 
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other party reasons that he is sure of his money, with the wallet in
his possession, and he sometimes dishonestly purposes appropriating the 
entire contents to his own use.&nbsp; He pays the ten dollars to the finder
of the book, who hurries off, saying that he has just time to catch the 
train by which he intends leaving the city.&nbsp; Upon examining the 
wallet, the victim finds that its contents consist of a wad of paper 
wrapped in a wretched counterfeit note.&nbsp; He has given his ten dollars 
for a collection of worthless paper.</p>
<p>It would require a volume to describe all the swindles and rogueries 
carried on in this city.&nbsp; The instances we have presented will be 
sufficient to give the reader an insight into the subject, and to warn him 
against the wiles of the sharpers which assail him even in his own 
home.</p>
<h2><!-- page 756--><a name="page756"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
756</span>LXX.&nbsp; ROBERT BONNER.</h2>
<p>The circulation of the <i>New York Ledger</i> is over 300,000 copies, 
and its readers cannot be far short of one million of people.&nbsp; To all 
these the name of <span class="smcap">Robert Bonner</span> is as familiar 
as that of his paper.</p>
<p>He was born in the north of Ireland, near Londonderry, in 1824.&nbsp; He
came to this country when a mere child, and was brought up in the State of 
Connecticut, where he received a good common school education.&nbsp; He was
apprenticed to the printer&rsquo;s trade at an early age, and began his 
apprenticeship in the office of the Hartford <i>Courant</i>.&nbsp; He came 
to New York at the age of twenty, and obtained employment in the office of 
a political journal, which soon suspended publication.&nbsp; He then 
secured a position in the office of the <i>Evening Mirror</i>, from which 
he passed to the post of foreman in the office of a small, struggling, 
commercial paper, called the <i>Merchants&rsquo; Ledger</i>.&nbsp; In a 
year or two after forming this connection, he purchased the <i>Ledger</i>, 
and determined to change both its character and form, and convert it into a
literary journal.&nbsp; He had the good sense to perceive that there was a 
great need of a cheap literary journal, suited to the comprehension and 
tastes of the masses, who cared nothing for the higher class 
periodicals.&nbsp; He proceeded very cautiously, however, and it was not 
until some time after that he made the <i>Ledger</i> entirely a literary 
paper, and issued it in its present form.&nbsp; He induced Fanny Fern, who 
was then in the flush of the reputation gained for her by her &ldquo;Ruth 
Hall,&rdquo; to write him a story, ten columns long, and paid her one 
thousand dollars in cash for it.&nbsp; He double-leaded the story, and made
it twenty columns in length, and advertised in nearly <!-- page 757--><a 
name="page757"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 757</span>every newspaper of 
prominence in the country that he was publishing a story for which he had 
paid one hundred dollars per column.&nbsp; His mode of advertising was 
entirely new, and was sneered at at the time as a 
&ldquo;sensational.&rdquo;&nbsp; It accomplished its object, however.&nbsp;
It attracted the attention of the readers of the papers, and they bought 
the <i>Ledger</i> &ldquo;to see what it was.&rdquo;&nbsp; They liked the 
paper, and since then there has been no abatement in the demand for 
it.&nbsp; The venture was entirely successful.&nbsp; Mr. Bonner&rsquo;s 
energy and genius, and Fanny Fern&rsquo;s popularity, placed the 
<i>Ledger</i> on a substantial footing from the start, and out of the 
profits of the story for which he had paid such an unusually large price, 
Mr. Bonner purchased a handsome city residence.</p>
<p>He did not content himself with Fanny Fern, though she became a regular 
contributor to his paper.&nbsp; He secured the services of Edward Everett, 
offering him ten thousand dollars for a series of papers, the money to be 
devoted to the purchase of Mount Vernon, an object very dear to the heart 
of the great orator.&nbsp; Mr. Bonner not only secured a valuable 
contributor, but won a warm personal friend in Mr. Everett.&nbsp; The 
latter continued his connection with the <i>Ledger</i> until the close of 
his life.&nbsp; Mr. Bonner also secured as regular contributors to his 
paper George Bancroft, the historian, James Parton (Fanny Fern&rsquo;s 
husband), Henry Ward Beecher, and many of the leading men of the country, 
and a number of brilliant and popular female writers.</p>
<p>The <i>Ledger</i> is steadily growing in the public favor.&nbsp; From 
the profits of his paper, Mr. Bonner has erected a splendid marble 
publishing house, at the corner of William and Spruce streets, in New York,
from which the <i>Ledger</i> is now issued.&nbsp; It is one of the most 
complete establishments in the country, and is fitted up with every 
convenience necessary to the performance of the work upon the paper in the 
most complete and expeditious manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Bonner is married, and has a family.&nbsp; He owns a country seat in
Westchester county, to which he repairs in the summer.&nbsp; His city 
residence is on the south side of Fifty-sixth street, a <!-- page 758--><a 
name="page758"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 758</span>few doors west of the
Fifth avenue.&nbsp; It is a handsome brown stone mansion.&nbsp; In the rear
of it, on Fifty-fifth street, is his stable, a large and tasteful edifice 
of brick.&nbsp; It is the most perfect establishment of its kind in the 
country.&nbsp; Everything is at hand that is necessary for the comfort and 
care of the horses, and the men in charge of the place are thoroughly 
skilled in their business.&nbsp; Mr. Bonner owns seven of the finest horses
in the world.&nbsp; First on the list is &ldquo;Dexter,&rdquo; the fastest 
horse &ldquo;on the planet.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has made his mile in 
2.17&frac14; in harness, and 2.18 under the saddle.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lantern,&rdquo; a splendid bay, 15&frac12; hands high, has made his 
mile in 2.20.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pocahontas&rdquo; has made her mile in 2.23, and
&ldquo;Peerless,&rdquo; a fine gray mare, has followed close on to her in 
2.23&frac14;.&nbsp; The former is said to be the most perfectly formed 
horse in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Palmer&rdquo; has made 2 miles, with 
a 350 pound wagon and driver, in 4.59, while her companion, &ldquo;Flatbush
Mare,&rdquo; has made a 2 mile heat to a road wagon in 5.01&frac14;.&nbsp; 
The &ldquo;Auburn Horse,&rdquo; a large sorrel, 16&frac12; hands high, with
four white feet and a white face, was declared by Hiram Woodruff to be the 
fastest horse he ever drove.&nbsp; These horses cost their owner over two 
hundred thousand dollars, and he would not part with them for double that 
sum.&nbsp; He will not race them, though almost every inducement has been 
offered him to do so, as he is opposed to racing for money.&nbsp; He bought
them for his own enjoyment, and drives them himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p8.jpg">
<img alt="ROBERT BONNER." src="images/p8.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Mr. Bonner is now very wealthy.&nbsp; He lives simply, however, and 
detests and shuns personal notoriety or ostentation.&nbsp; He has the 
reputation of being a warm-hearted, generous man, and has many 
friends.&nbsp; He is short, thick-set, and solidly made.&nbsp; His hair is 
sandy, his complexion florid, his forehead large and thoughtful, his eye 
bright and pleasant, and his manner frank, genial, and winning.</p>
<h2><!-- page 759--><a name="page759"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
759</span>LXXI.&nbsp; PUBLIC BUILDINGS.</h2>
<p>The Public Buildings of New York are not numerous.&nbsp; Some of them 
are handsome, and others are models of ugliness.&nbsp; We shall mention 
here only those which are not described elsewhere in this volume.</p>
<p>The most prominent is the City Hall, which is located in the City Hall 
Park.&nbsp; It faces the south, and the ground line is perpendicular to 
Broadway.&nbsp; It is a handsome edifice, and is surmounted by the best 
clock tower in the Union, above which is a marble image of Justice.&nbsp; 
The front and ends of the City Hall are constructed of white marble, but 
the rear face is of brown stone.&nbsp; The building was erected between the
years 1803 and 1810, and the city fathers, sagely premising that New York 
would never extend above the Park, decided to save the difference between 
marble and brown stone at this side, &ldquo;as this portion would face the 
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The building contains the offices of the Mayor and 
city officials.&nbsp; Some of its rooms are very handsome, and are 
elegantly decorated.</p>
<p>The clock tower and the upper portions of the building were set on fire 
by the pyrotechnical display in honor of the Atlantic Telegraph of 
1859.&nbsp; They were rebuilt soon afterwards, in much better style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previous to the completion of the new cupola, our city fathers 
contracted with Messrs. Sperry &amp; Co., the celebrated tower-clock makers
of Broadway, to build a clock for it, at a cost not exceeding four thousand
dollars, that our citizens might place the utmost reliance upon, as a 
time-keeper of unvarying correctness.&nbsp; During the month of April the 
clock was completed, and the busy thousands who were daily wont to look up 
<!-- page 760--><a name="page760"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 760</span>to
the silent monitor, above which the figure of Justice was enthroned, hailed
its appearance with the utmost satisfaction.&nbsp; It is undoubtedly the 
finest specimen of a tower-clock on this side of the Atlantic, and, as an 
accurate time-keeper, competent judges pronounce it to be unsurpassed in 
the world.&nbsp; The main wheels are thirty inches in diameter, the 
escapement is jewelled, and the pendulum, which is in itself a curiosity, 
is over fourteen feet in length.&nbsp; It is a curious fact that the 
pendulum bob weighs over three hundred pounds; but so finely finished is 
every wheel, pinion, and pivot in the clock, and so little power is 
required to drive them, that a weight of only one hundred pounds is all 
that is necessary to keep this ponderous mass of metal vibrating, and turn 
four pairs of hands on the dials of the cupola.&nbsp; The clock does not 
stand, as many suppose, directly behind the dials, but in the story below, 
and a perpendicular iron rod, twenty-five feet in length, connects it with 
the dial-works above.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p760.jpg">
<img alt="THE CITY HALL." src="images/p760.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>To the east of the City Hall, and within the limits of the Park, is the 
Hall of Records, a stone building, covered with stucco.&nbsp; It was 
erected in 1757, as a city prison.&nbsp; It is now occupied by the 
Registrar of the city and his clerks.</p>
<p><!-- page 761--><a name="page761"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
761</span>In the rear of the City Hall, and fronting on Chambers street, is
the New County Court House, which, when completed, will be one of the 
finest edifices in the New World.&nbsp; It was begun more than eight years 
ago, and is constructed of &ldquo;East Chester and Massachusetts white 
marble, with iron beams and supports, iron staircases, outside iron doors, 
solid black-walnut doors (on the inside), and marble tiling on every 
hall-floor of the building, laid upon iron beams, concreted over, and 
bricked up.&nbsp; With a basis of concrete, Georgia-pine, over yellow-pine,
is used for the flooring of the apartments.&nbsp; The iron supports and 
beams are of immense strength&mdash;some of the girders crossing the rooms 
weighing over fifty thousand pounds.&nbsp; The pervading order of 
architecture is Corinthian, but, although excellent, the building cannot be
said to be purely Corinthian.&nbsp; An additional depth of, say, thirty 
feet, would have prevented a cramping of the windows on the sides, which 
now necessarily exists, and have added power and comprehension to the 
structure as an entirety; but the general effect is grand and striking in 
the extreme.&nbsp; The building is two hundred and fifty feet long, and one
hundred and fifty feet wide.&nbsp; From the base-course to the top of the 
pediment the height is ninety-seven feet, and to the top of the dome, not 
yet erected, two hundred and twenty-five feet.&nbsp; From the sidewalk to 
the top of the pediment measures eighty-two feet; to the top of the dome 
two hundred and ten feet.&nbsp; When completed, the building will be 
surmounted by a large dome, giving a general resemblance to the main 
portion of the Capitol at Washington.&nbsp; The dome, viewed from the rear,
appears something heavy and cumbrous for the general character of the 
structure which it crowns; but a front view, from Chambers street, when the
eye, in its upward sweep, takes in the broad flight of steps, the grand 
columns, and the general robustness of the main entrance, dissipates this 
idea, and attaches grace and integrity to the whole.&nbsp; One of the most 
novel features of the dome will be the arrangement of the tower, crowning 
its apex, into a light-house, which, from its extreme power and height, it 
is supposed, will furnish guidance to vessels as far out at sea as that 
afforded by any beacon on the <!-- page 762--><a name="page762"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 762</span>neighboring coast.&nbsp; This is the 
suggestion of the architect, Mr. Kellum, but, whether or not it will be 
carried out in the execution of the design, Mr. Tucker, the superintendent 
of the work, is unable to say.&nbsp; The interior of the edifice is equally
elaborate and complete, and several of the apartments are now occupied by 
the County Clerk, the Supreme Court, and as other offices.&nbsp; The 
portico and stoop, now being completed, on Chambers street, will, it is 
said, be the finest piece of work of the kind in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this building which furnished the Ring with their favorite 
pretext for stealing the public money.&nbsp; The manner in which this was 
done has been described in another chapter.</p>
<p>The Bible House is a massive structure of red brick, with brown stone 
trimmings, and covers the block bounded by Third and Fourth avenues and 
Eighth and Ninth streets.&nbsp; It covers three-quarters of an acre, its 
four fronts measuring a total of 710 feet.&nbsp; It was completed in 1853, 
at a cost, including the ground, of $303,000, and is to-day worth nearly 
double that sum.&nbsp; It contains fifty stores and offices, which yield an
aggregate annual rent of nearly $40,000.&nbsp; These rooms are occupied 
chiefly by benevolent and charitable societies, so that the Bible House has
become the great centre from which radiate the principal labors of charity 
and benevolence in the City and State.</p>
<p>The Bible House is owned by, and forms the headquarters of the American 
Bible Society.&nbsp; The Bibles of this Society are printed here, every 
portion of their publication being carried on under this vast roof.&nbsp; 
The receipts of the Society since its organization in 1816 have amounted to
nearly $6,000,000.&nbsp; Thousands of copies are annually printed and 
distributed from here.&nbsp; The entire Union has been canvassed three 
times by the agents of the Society, and hundreds of thousands of destitute 
families have been furnished each with a copy of the Blessed Book.&nbsp; 
The Bible has been printed here in twenty-nine different languages, and 
parts of it have been issued in other languages.</p>
<p>About 625 persons find employment in this gigantic establishment.&nbsp; 
Of these about three hundred are girls, and twenty or thirty boys.&nbsp; 
The girls feed the presses, sew the books, apply <!-- page 763--><a 
name="page763"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 763</span>gold-leaf to the 
covers ready for tooling, etc.&nbsp; About a dozen little girls are 
employed in the press-room in laying the sheets, of the best description of
Bibles, between glazed boards, and so preparing them for being placed in 
the hydraulic presses.&nbsp; Every day there are six thousand Bibles 
printed in this establishment, and three hundred and fifty turned out of 
hand completely bound and finished.</p>

<p>Tammany Hall, in East Fourteenth street, between Irving Place and Third 
avenue, is a handsome edifice of red brick, with white marble 
trimmings.&nbsp; It contains several fine halls, and a number of committee 
rooms.&nbsp; The main hall is one of the handsomest in the city, and was 
formerly used as a theatre.&nbsp; It was in this hall that the National 
Democratic Convention of 1868 was held.&nbsp; The building is the property 
of the &ldquo;Tammany Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Society was organized in 
1789 as a <!-- page 764--><a name="page764"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

organization and the ruling power in the Democratic politics of the City

<p>The Academy of Design is located at the northwest corner of Fourth 
avenue and Twenty-third street.&nbsp; It is one of the most beautiful 
edifices in the city.&nbsp; It is built in the pure Gothic style of the 
thirteenth century, and the external walls are composed of variegated 
marble.&nbsp; It has an air of lightness and elegance, that at once elicit 
the admiration of the gazer.&nbsp; The interior is finished with white 
pine, ash, mahogany, oak, and black walnut in their natural colors; no 
paint being used in the building.&nbsp; Schools of art, a library, reading 
room, lecture room, and the necessary rooms for the business of the 
institution, occupy the first and second stories.&nbsp; The third floor is 
devoted <!-- page 766--><a name="page766"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>One of the most imposing buildings in the city is the new Grand Central 
Depot, on Forty-second street and Fourth avenue.&nbsp; It is constructed of
red brick, with iron trimmings painted white, in imitation of marble.&nbsp;
The south front is adorned with three and the west front with two massive 
pavilions.&nbsp; The central pavilion of each front contains an illuminated
clock.&nbsp; The entire building is 696 feet long and 240 feet wide.&nbsp; 
The space for the accommodation of the trains is 610 feet long and 200 feet
wide.&nbsp; The remainder of the edifice is devoted to the offices of the 
various railways using it.&nbsp; Waiting-rooms, baggage-rooms, etc.&nbsp; 
The car-shed is covered with an immense circular roof of iron and 
glass.&nbsp; The remainder of the building is of brick and iron.&nbsp; The 
principal front is on Forty-second street.&nbsp; This portion is to be 
occupied by the offices and waiting-rooms of the New York and New Haven and
the Shore Line railways.&nbsp; The southern portion of the west front is 
occupied by the offices and waiting-rooms of the New York, Harlem, and 
Albany Railway, and the remainder of this front by the offices and 
waiting-rooms of the Hudson River and New York Central railways.&nbsp; 
These roads are the only lines which enter the city, and they are here 
provided with a common terminus in the very heart of the metropolis.&nbsp; 
The waiting-rooms and offices are finished in hard wood, are handsomely 
frescoed, and are supplied with every convenience.&nbsp; The height of the 
roof of the main body of the depot is 100 feet from the ground; the apex of
the central pavilion on Forty-second street is 160 feet from the 
ground.</p>
<p>The car-house constitutes the main body of the depot.&nbsp; It is 
lighted from the roof by day, and at night large reflectors, lighted by an 
electrical apparatus, illuminate the vast interior.&nbsp; The platforms 
between the tracks are composed of stone blocks.&nbsp; Each road has a 
particular portion assigned to it, and there is no confusion in any of the 
arrangements.&nbsp; The roof is supported by thirty-one handsome iron 
trusses, each weighing forty tons, and <!-- page 767--><a 
name="page767"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 767</span>extending in an 
unbroken arch over the entire enclosure.&nbsp; The glass plates in the roof
measure 80,000 feet.&nbsp; The interior of the car-house is painted in 
light colors, which harmonize well with the light which falls through the 
crystal roof.</p>
<p>About eighty trains enter and depart from this depot every day.&nbsp; 
The running of these is regulated by the depot-master, who occupies an 
elevated position at the north end of the car-house, from which he can see 
the track for several miles.&nbsp; A system of automatic signals governs 
the running of the trains through the city.</p>
<p>The building was projected by Commodore Vanderbilt.&nbsp; Ground was 
broken for it on the 15th of November, 1869, and it was ready for occupancy
on the 9th of October, 1871.</p>

768</span>LXXII.&nbsp; PATENT DIVORCES.</h2>
<p>It may not be generally known in other parts of the country, but it is 
very well understood in the city, that New York is the headquarters of a 
powerful Ring of corrupt and unscrupulous lawyers, whose business is to 
violate the law of the land, and procure by fraud divorces which will not 
be granted by any court after a fair and full hearing of the case.&nbsp; It
may be asserted at the outset, that those who are fairly and justly 
entitled to such a separation, never seek it through the Divorce Ring.</p>
<p>In any issue of certain city newspapers, you will see such 
advertisements as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ABSOLUTE DIVORCES LEGALLY OBTAINED, in New York, and States, where 
desertion, drunkenness, etc., etc., are sufficient cause.&nbsp; No 
publicity; no charge until divorce obtained; advice free.&nbsp; M--- B---, 
attorney, 56 --- street.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The all-sufficient cause with these lawyers is the desire for a 
separation on the part of the husband or wife, and they never trouble 
themselves with questions of law or morality.&nbsp; The law of New York 
allows a divorce with the right to marry again, upon one ground 
only&mdash;that of adultery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lawyers of the Divorce Ring are the pariahs of their 
profession&mdash;men who have been debarred in other States (sometimes in 
other countries) for detected malpractice; men who began life fairly, but 
sank into ignominy through dissipation, political failure, or natural 
vicious tendencies; men, even, who never opened a law-book before entering 
upon their present avocation, but gleaned a practical knowledge of the 
legal alternative of &lsquo;wedded woe&rsquo; by a course of training in 
the private detective&rsquo;s trade.&nbsp; These latter worthies often hire
the use of practising <!-- page 769--><a name="page769"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 769</span>lawyers&rsquo; names.&nbsp; Occasionally they 
hire the said lawyers themselves to go through the mummeries of the courts 
for them; and we could name one of our most eloquent and respectable 
criminal pleaders who, on a certain occasion at least, permitted himself to
be nominally associated with one of the boldest operators of the Ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dens of the divorcers are situated chiefly on the 
thoroughfares most affected by lawyers of the highest caste, though even 
Broadway is not wholly exempt from them; and Wall street, Pine street, and 
especially Nassau street, contain a goodly number each.&nbsp; Without any 
ostentatious display of signs or identifications, they are generally 
furnished in the common law-office style, with substantial desks and 
chairs, shelves of law-books, and usually a shady private apartment for 
consultations.&nbsp; Sometimes the name upon the &lsquo;directory&rsquo; of
the building and name over the &lsquo;office&rsquo; itself will be spelled 
differently, though conveying the same sound; as though the proprietor 
thereof might have occasional use for a confusion of personalities.&nbsp; 
Along the stairs and hallways leading to these dens, at almost any hour of 
the day, from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M., may be met women in flashy finery and men 
with hats drawn down over their eyes&mdash;all manifestly gravitating, with
more or less shamefacedness, towards the places in question.&nbsp; They may
be dissolute actresses, seeking a spurious appearance of law to end an old 
alliance and prepare for a new one.&nbsp; They may be the frivolous, 
extravagant, reckless wives of poor clerks or hard-working mechanics, 
infatuatedly following out the first consequences of a matin&eacute;e at 
the theatre and a &lsquo;Personal&rsquo; in the <i>Herald</i>.&nbsp; They 
may be the worthless husbands of unsuspecting, faithful wives, who, by 
sickness, or some other unwitting provocation, have turned the unstable 
husbandly mind to thoughts of connubial pastures new and the advertising 
divorcers.&nbsp; They may be the &lsquo;lovers&rsquo; of married women, who
come to engage fabricated testimony and surreptitious unmarriage for the 
frail creatures whose virtue is still too cowardly to dare the more honest 
sin.&nbsp; They are not the wronged partners of marriage, who, by the 
mysterious chastising providence of outraged hearths and homes, are <!-- 
page 770--><a name="page770"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
770</span>compelled, in bitterest agony of soul, to invoke justice of the 
law for the honor based upon right and religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manufacture of &lsquo;a case&rsquo; by the contrabandists of 
divorce is often such a marvel of unscrupulous audacity, that its very 
lawlessness constitutes in itself a kind of legal security.&nbsp; So wholly
does it ignore all the conventionalities of mere legal evasion, as to 
virtually lapse into a barbarism, knowing neither law nor 
civilization.&nbsp; A young woman in flaunting jockey hat, extravagant 
&lsquo;chignon,&rsquo; and gaudy dress, flirts into the den, and turns a 
bold, half-defiant face upon the rakish masculine figure at the principal 
desk.&nbsp; The figure looks up, a glance between the two tells the story, 
and the woman is invited to step into the consulting-room (if there be 
one), and give her husband&rsquo;s name and offence.&nbsp; A divorce will 
cost her say twenty-five, or fifty, or seventy-five dollars&mdash;in fact, 
whatever sum she can afford to pay for such a trifle.&nbsp; She can have it
obtained for her in New York, or at the West, just as her husband&rsquo;s 
likelihood to pry into things, or her own taste in the matter, may render 
advisable.&nbsp; Not a word of the case can possibly get into the papers in
either locality.&nbsp; She can charge &lsquo;intemperance,&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;desertion,&rsquo; or &lsquo;failure to support,&rsquo; or whatever 
else she chooses; but, perhaps, it would be better to make it adultery, as 
that can be just as easily proved, and &lsquo;holds good in any 
State.&rsquo;&nbsp; This point being decided, the young woman can go home, 
and there keep her luckless wretch of a husband properly in the dark until 
her &lsquo;decree&rsquo; is ready for her.&nbsp; If the applicant is a man,
the work is all the easier; for then even less art will be required to keep
the unconscious &lsquo;party of the second part&rsquo; in ignorance of the 
proceedings.&nbsp; The case is now quietly put on record in the proper 
court (if the &lsquo;suit&rsquo; is to be &lsquo;tried&rsquo; in New York),
and a &lsquo;summons&rsquo; prepared for service upon the 
&lsquo;defendant.&rsquo;&nbsp; To serve this summons, any idle boy is 
called in from the street, and directed to take the paper to 
defendant&rsquo;s residence or place of business, and there serve it upon 
him.&nbsp; Away goes the boy, willing enough to earn fifty cents by this 
easy task, and is met upon the stoop of the residence, or before the door 
of the place of business, by a confederate of the <!-- page 771--><a 
name="page771"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 771</span>divorce-lawyer, who 
sharply asks what he wants.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want to see Mr. ---,&rsquo; says
the boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am Mr. ---,&rsquo; returns the confederate, who is 
thereupon served with the summons.&nbsp; Back hurries the boy to the 
law-office, signs an affidavit that he has served the paper upon defendant 
in person, is paid for the job, and goes about his business.&nbsp; The time
selected for the man&oelig;uvre is, of course, adapted to what the 
&lsquo;plaintiff&rsquo; has revealed of her husband&rsquo;s hours for home 
or for business; and, after the improvised server of the 
&lsquo;summons&rsquo; has once sworn to his affidavit and disappeared, 
there is no such thing as ever finding him again!&nbsp; A &lsquo;copy of 
the complaint&rsquo; is &lsquo;served&rsquo; in the same way; or, the 
&lsquo;summons&rsquo; is published once a week for a month in the smallest 
type of the smallest obscure weekly paper to be found.&nbsp; This latter 
device, however, is adopted only when the plaintiff (having some moral 
scruples about too much perjury at once) charges &lsquo;desertion,&rsquo; 
and desires to appear quite ignorant of unnatural defendant&rsquo;s present
place of abode.&nbsp; If, for any particular reason, the party seeking a 
divorce prefers a Western decree, the &lsquo;lawyer,&rsquo; or a clerk of 
his, starts at once for Indiana, or some quiet county of Illinois; and, 
after hiring a room in some tavern or farm-house in the name of his client 
(to establish the requisite fact of residence!), gives the case into the 
hands of a local attorney with whom he has a business partnership.&nbsp; 
This Western branch of the trade has reached such licence that, not long 
ago, a notorious practitioner of the Ring actually issued an advertisement 
in a paper of New York, to the effect that he had just returned to this 
city from the West with a fresh stock of blank divorces!&nbsp; The wording 
was not literally thus, but such was its obvious and only 
signification.&nbsp; Whether the &lsquo;trial&rsquo; is to take place in 
New York or Indiana, however, there is but one system commonly adopted in 
offering proof of the truth of the complaint upon which a divorce is 
demanded.&nbsp; Plaintiff&rsquo;s villainous attorney, after waiting a due 
length of time for some response from the defendant in the case(!), asks of
the Court, as privately as possible, the appointment of a referee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Honor the Court, upon learning that &lsquo;defendant&rsquo; 
does <!-- page 772--><a name="page772"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
772</span>not oppose (of course not!), names a referee, who shall hear the 
testimony in the case, and submit a copy thereof, together with his 
decision thereon, to the Court for confirmation.&nbsp; Then, before the 
referee&mdash;who is to be properly feed for his officiation&mdash;go the 
divorce-lawyer and two or three shabby-genteel-looking 
&lsquo;witnesses,&rsquo; who from thenceforth shall never be findable by 
mortal man again.&nbsp; The &lsquo;witnesses&rsquo; swear to any thing and 
every thing&mdash;that they have seen and recognized defendant in highly 
improper houses with improper persons; that they know plaintiff to be pure,
faithful, and shamefully misused in the marriage relation, etc., etc.&nbsp;
As &lsquo;defendant,&rsquo; not even aware that he or she <i>is</i> a 
&lsquo;defendant,&rsquo; makes no appearance, either in person or by 
counsel, to combat this dreadful evidence, the referee must, of course, 
render decision for plaintiff&mdash;&lsquo;the law awards it, and the Court
doth give it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The judge subsequently confirms this decision; a
decree of full divorce is granted, <i>in due and full legal form</i>, to 
the triumphant plaintiff; and the &lsquo;defendant&rsquo; is likely to 
become aware of the suit for the first time on that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acts of the divorce Ring are no secrets in New York.&nbsp; Yet 
neither the judges nor the Bar Association make any efforts to rid the 
courts of such wretches.&nbsp; &ldquo;A citizen of New York, whose 
misguided wife had secretly obtained a fraudulent divorce from him through 
such practice as we have described, and who, in turn, had successfully sued
in the legitimate way for the dissolution of marriage thus forced upon him,
sought to induce his legal adviser, a veteran metropolitan lawyer of the 
highest standing, to expose the infamous divorce &lsquo;Ring&rsquo; before 
the courts, and demand, in behalf of his profession, that its practitioners
should be at least disbarred.&nbsp; The response was, that the courts were 
presumed to be entirely ignorant of the fraudulent parts of the proceedings
referred to; that the offenders could be &lsquo;cornered&rsquo; only 
through a specific case in point against them, and, besides, that the 
referees in their cases were nearly all connected, either consanguinely or 
in bonds of partnership interest, with the judges who had appointed them, 
and before whom the motion for disbarment would probably come!&nbsp; For 
<!-- page 773--><a name="page773"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
773</span>this last curious reason no lawyer could, consistently with his 
own best interests, inaugurate a movement likely to involve the whole 
referee system in its retributive effects.&nbsp; A lawyer so doing might, 
when arguing future cases in court, find a certain apparent disposition of 
the Bench to show him less courtesy than on former occasions&mdash;to snub 
him, in fact, and thereby permanently prejudice his professional future 
likelihoods in that jurisdiction!&rdquo;</p>

774</span>LXXIII.&nbsp; THE CROTON WATER WORKS.</h2>
<p>There were many plans for supplying the city of New York with fresh 
water, previous to the adoption of the Croton Aqueduct scheme, but we have 
not the space to present them here.&nbsp; They were all inadequate to the 
necessities of the city, and all in turn were thrown aside.&nbsp; The most 
important was one for obtaining the water supply from the Bronx 
River.&nbsp; It was believed that a daily supply of 3,000,000 gallons could
be obtained from this stream, but nothing was done in the matter, and it 
was not until the prevalence of Asiatic Cholera in 1832 had impressed upon 
the people the necessity of a supply of pure water, nor until the great 
fire of 1837 had convinced them that they must have an abundance of water, 
that the scheme for supplying the city from the sources of the Croton River
was definitely resolved upon.&nbsp; De Witt Clinton gave his powerful 
support to the scheme, and the citizens at the municipal elections 
expressed themselves unqualifiedly in favor of a full supply of fresh 
water.&nbsp; It was decided to obtain the supply from the Croton River, and
in May, 1837, the work on the aqueduct which was to convey it to the city 
was actually begun, and on the 4th of July, 1842, the Croton water was 
distributed through the city.</p>
<p>The first step was to throw a massive dam across the Croton River, by 
means of which the Croton Lake was formed, the water being raised to a 
depth of forty feet by the obstruction.&nbsp; From this dam an aqueduct, 
constructed of brick, stone, and cement, conveys the water to the city, a 
distance of nearly forty miles.&nbsp; It is arched above and below, and is 
seven and a half feet wide, and eight and a half feet high, with an 
inclination of <!-- page 775--><a name="page775"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 775</span>thirteen inches to the mile.&nbsp; It rests on
the ground for a portion of its course, and in other parts is supported by 
a series of stone arches.&nbsp; It crosses twenty-five streams in 
Westchester County, besides numerous brooks, which flow under it through 
culverts.&nbsp; It is conveyed across the Harlem River by means of the High
Bridge.&nbsp; The water flows through vast iron pipes, which rest upon the 
bridge.&nbsp; The bridge is a magnificent stone structure, 1450 feet long, 
with fifteen arches, the highest of which is one hundred feet above high 
water mark.&nbsp; Its great height prevents it from interfering with the 
navigation of the stream.&nbsp; The High Bridge is one of the principal 
resorts in the suburbs of New York.&nbsp; The structure itself is well 
worth seeing, and the scenery is famed for its surpassing loveliness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p775.jpg">
<img alt="THE HIGH BRIDGE." src="images/p775.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>There are two large reservoirs at the city end of the bridge, the 
&ldquo;Storage Reservoir,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;High Service,&rdquo; the 
latter of which is designed for supplying the elevated section of <!-- page
776--><a name="page776"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 776</span>Washington 
Heights.&nbsp; From here to the distributing reservoirs in the Central 
Park, which have already been described, the distance is two and a quarter 
miles.&nbsp; The distributing reservoir for the principal part of the city 
is on Fifth Avenue, between Fortieth and Forty-second streets.&nbsp; It 
covers about four acres of ground, and is built of granite.&nbsp; It is 
forty feet above the street, is divided into two parts, and will hold 
20,000,000 gallons of water.&nbsp; It is exactly forty-one miles from the 
Croton Lake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p776.jpg">
<img alt="THE FIFTH AVENUE RESERVOIR." src="images/p776.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The daily flow of water through the aqueduct is 60,000,000 gallons, its 
full capacity.&nbsp; The reservoirs hold over 2,000,000,000 gallons, or 
about fifteen days, supply.&nbsp; Nearly four hundred miles of main pipes 
distribute the water through the city, and supply it to 67,000 dwelling 
houses and stores, 1624 manufactories, 290 hospitals, prisons, schools, and
public buildings, 307 churches, and 14 markets.&nbsp; There are 72 drinking
hydrants, and a number of ornamental fountains in the city.&nbsp; The lakes
and fountains in the Central Park are all formed by the Croton water, which
is also supplied to the State Prison at Sing Sing, and the Institutions on 
Blackwell&rsquo;s, Randall&rsquo;s, and Ward&rsquo;s <!-- page 777--><a 
name="page777"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 777</span>islands.&nbsp; The 
Croton River is one of the purest streams in the world.&nbsp; The water is 
bright and sparkling, and there is no sediment perceptible to the naked 
eye.&nbsp; Actual analysis has shown that the amount of impurity during an 
entire summer was but 4.45 grains in a gallon, or 7.63 parts in 100,000 
parts.</p>
<p>The original cost of the aqueduct and reservoirs was about 
$9,000,000.&nbsp; Since then the increased supply, the new reservoirs, 
pipes, etc., have made the total amount upward of $40,000,000.&nbsp; The 
total receipts from the water tax since the opening of the aqueduct have 
amounted to about $22,000,000.&nbsp; The tax at present amounts to about 
$1,232,000 annually.</p>

778</span>LXXIV.&nbsp; EXCURSIONS.</h2>
<p>The suburbs of New York are very attractive, and excursions to nearly 
every point within reach of the city are made every day during the summer 
months.&nbsp; The fares are low, and a day may be pleasantly spent on the 
water by leaving the city about 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and 
returning at 6 or 7 P.M.</p>
<p>One of the pleasantest excursions of this kind, is up the Hudson.&nbsp; 
One may go as far as West Point or Poughkeepsie, and enjoy the magnificent 
scenery of the famous river, or he may leave the boat at West Point, and 
spend an hour or two at that place before the arrival of the down 
boat.&nbsp; The steamers on the Hudson are the best of their kind, and 
afford every opportunity for enjoyment.</p>
<p>Staten Island, in New York Bay, seven miles from the city, and in full 
sight of it, offers many attractions to the pleasure seeker.&nbsp; There 
are several lines of steamers plying between the city and the towns on that
island, and making hourly trips.&nbsp; The sail across the bay is 
delightful, and the fare is only ten or twelve cents each way.</p>
<p>Another trip, and one which should never be omitted by strangers 
visiting the city, is from Peck Slip up the East River to 
One-hundred-and-thirtieth street, or Harlem.&nbsp; The route lies along the
entire East River front of the city, with Brooklyn, Williamsburg, and Long 
Island City on the opposite shores.&nbsp; Blackwell&rsquo;s, 
Randall&rsquo;s, and Ward&rsquo;s islands, with their magnificent edifices,
are passed, and Hell Gate is an additional attraction.&nbsp; One is given a
better idea of the size of New York and Brooklyn in this way, than in 
almost any other.&nbsp; Not the least of the attractions is the United 
States Navy Yard, at Brooklyn, an admirable <!-- page 779--><a 
name="page779"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 779</span>view of which may be 
obtained from the deck of the steamer in passing it.&nbsp; The boats run 
hourly from Peck Slip and Harlem.&nbsp; The fare is ten cents each 
way.&nbsp; In the summer time there is a line of steamers plying between 
Harlem and the High Bridge, and connecting with the Peck Slip boats.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p779.jpg">
<img alt="U.S. NAVY YARD, BROOKLYN." src="images/p779.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The towns on Long Island Sound are also connected with New York by lines
of steamers.&nbsp; These are among the pleasant objective points for 
excursionists within reach of the city.</p>
<p>The old route to Philadelphia, by way of South Amboy, offers another 
attraction.&nbsp; The boat is a fine and powerful steamer, and makes two 
trips daily between New York and South Amboy.&nbsp; Sometimes the route 
lies through the picturesque Kill Van Kull, or Staten Island Sound, or 
through the Narrows, into the Outer Bay, and around Staten Island into 
Raritan Bay.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The famous resorts of Rockaway and Coney Island are reached in from one 
to two hours by steamer.&nbsp; At either of these places a day may be spent
on the sea shore.&nbsp; The surf-bathing is excellent at both, and each may
also be reached by a railway.&nbsp; Of late years, Coney Island has become 
a favorite resort of the roughs of New York and Brooklyn, and, as a 
consequence, is not as attractive to respectable visitors as formerly.</p>
<p>Perhaps the pleasantest of all the excursions, except the trip up the 
Hudson, is the sail from the city to Sandy Hook and back on the Long Branch
boats.&nbsp; These are magnificent steamers, and make several trips each 
day during the summer season.&nbsp; They connect at Sandy Hook with the 
railway to Long Branch.&nbsp; One may leave the city in the morning, spend 
the day at the Branch, enjoy a bath in the surf, and reach the New York 
pier again by 8 o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp; The round trip fare is 
<!-- page 781--><a name="page781"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
781</span>about two dollars.&nbsp; The boats are provided with every 
luxury, and are famous for their excellent table.&nbsp; A good band 
accompanies each, and discourses delicious music during the sail.&nbsp; The
route lies down the harbor through the Narrows, and down the Lower Bay to 
Sandy Hook, in full sight of the Atlantic, and near enough to it to feel 
the deep swelling of its restless breast.&nbsp; Those who do not care to 
visit Long Branch may make the round trip in four hours.</p>

782</span>LXXV.&nbsp; SAILORS IN NEW YORK.</h2>
<p>In the streets in the vicinity of the water, there are many buildings 
used as &ldquo;Sailors&rsquo; Boarding-houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; One would 
suppose that poor Jack needed a snug resting-place after his long and 
stormy voyages, but it is about the last thing he finds in New York.&nbsp; 
The houses for his accommodation are low, vile places.&nbsp; They are 
located in the filthiest sections of the city, and are never clean.&nbsp; 
Jack, however, is used to hard fare.&nbsp; He has spent six months, or it 
may be two years, in the damp and cheerless forecastle, and he will not 
grumble at the aspect of the only quarters available to him on shore.&nbsp;
He has crowded with twenty men and boys into a space much smaller than the 
chamber assigned him, and he does not object to having half a dozen room 
mates.&nbsp; The bed is a wretched cot, but it is better than a bunk or a 
hammock, and Jack is not so used to cleanliness as to make him very 
fastidious.</p>
<p>The boarding-house has a flashy air.&nbsp; There are bright curtains at 
the windows, and the entire front is usually painted some gaudy color, and 
is adorned with a sign, with the name of the establishment in gilt 
letters.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Sailor&rsquo;s Retreat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Our 
House,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sailor&rsquo;s Welcome Home,&rdquo; &ldquo;The 
Jolly Tar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Flowing Sea Inn&rdquo; are favorite names 
with these places.&nbsp; The entrance is generally low and narrow, and 
conducts the visitor to the main room, which is often the bar, of the 
house.&nbsp; This is a small, low-pitched apartment.&nbsp; The floor is 
sanded, and the ceiling is lined with tissue paper pendants cut in various 
designs.&nbsp; The mantelpiece is adorned with various seamen&rsquo;s 
trophies and curiosities from foreign lands, the majority of which have 
been stolen from the poor fellows, who brought <!-- page 783--><a 
name="page783"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 783</span>them home for a 
different purpose.&nbsp; The bar is adorned with a multitude of bottles, 
decanters, and glasses, and the liquors give no indication to the eye of 
their deadly properties.&nbsp; A person accustomed to cross the ocean in 
the luxurious cabin of a Cunarder, would not find the place very 
attractive, but to Jack, who has never known anything better than the 
forecastle, it has many attractions, and he falls an easy victim to it.</p>
<p>The landlords of these places are simply the meanest of thieves and 
bullies.&nbsp; They charge a uniform price of about seven dollars per week,
for which they give a mean bed in a dirty room occupied by five or six 
other persons, and three indifferent meals a day.&nbsp; They do not, 
however, reap their profits from their legitimate business.&nbsp; Their 
principal earnings are gained by their crimes.</p>
<p>They keep their runners in the harbor on the watch for ships coming in 
from long voyages.&nbsp; These board the vessels as soon as they reach the 
bay, and at once begin to extol the merits of their several 
establishments.&nbsp; They are adepts at their art, and before the vessel 
has cast anchor at her berth, they have secured one or more men apiece for 
their houses.&nbsp; They never leave them after this, but &ldquo;stick to 
them&rdquo; until they receive their wages, after which they conduct them 
to the boarding-house, and turn them over to the landlord.&nbsp; If the 
sailor is unwilling to promise to become a guest at the boarding-house, the
runner has but little trouble in inducing him to &ldquo;drop in and look at
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The great object is to get him within its doors.&nbsp; The
first sense of freedom from the confinements of the ship is very grateful 
to Jack, and puts him in a good humor with himself and everybody 
else.&nbsp; This renders him the easier a victim.</p>
<p>When he has been brought within the portals of the boarding-house, the 
next step is to induce him to drink.&nbsp; Sailors are very tough, but even
they cannot stand up against the effects of the poisonous liquors sold 
here.&nbsp; If the landlord is not able to induce the new-comer to drink, 
the &ldquo;Jackal,&rdquo; or the porter, is called in.&nbsp; Jack never 
suspects the porter of any design upon him, but believes that the landlord 
is his only enemy, and the &ldquo;Jackal&rdquo; is usually 
successful.&nbsp; If it is found necessary to <!-- page 784--><a 
name="page784"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 784</span>make quick work of 
the case, the liquor is drugged; but, as a general rule, it is poisonous 
enough to stupefy even a strong man in a very short while.&nbsp; When the 
victim is fairly helpless, he is conducted to his room.&nbsp; There may be 
other &ldquo;boarders&rdquo; in this apartment, but they are generally too 
drunk to notice what is going on.&nbsp; The doors are utterly without 
fastenings, and are oiled to prevent them from creaking.&nbsp; When all is 
quiet, and the victim is plunged in a heavy slumber, the 
&ldquo;Jackal&rdquo; creeps up the stairs, enters the room, and robs the 
poor fellow of whatever money or valuables he may have on his person.&nbsp;
In the morning, when the sailor awakens, sick and disheartened, he 
discovers his loss.&nbsp; The landlord is full of sympathy for him, and is 
indignant that such an outrage should have been perpetrated beneath his 
roof.&nbsp; He has the house searched, and, if the sailor cannot be made 
drunk again, goes through the farce of causing the arrest of a 
&ldquo;stool-pigeon,&rdquo; who is of course discharged for lack of 
evidence against him.&nbsp; Usually, however, the sailor is made drunk, and
is gotten to sea again on a long voyage as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The various methods of forcing a sailor to sea are called 
&ldquo;Shanghaiing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The practice is resorted to by landlords, 
to enable them to complete the crews which they have contracted to furnish 
to vessels.&nbsp; The owners and masters of these vessels are fully aware 
of the infamous manner in which men are procured for them, but say they 
must either connive at it, or let their vessels go to sea 
shorthanded.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Shanghaiing&rdquo; a sober man, resort is had 
to false promises.&nbsp; He is induced to go on board of a vessel, 
&ldquo;to see how he likes her.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is then detained by force 
until the ship has left port.&nbsp; His true name is not entered on the 
list presented at the Custom House on the day before sailing, but he is 
passed under a fictitious name.&nbsp; When the wretches who carry on this 
business are very much pressed for men, they do not hesitate to waylay 
sailors, knock them senseless, and convey them on board vessels in this 
condition.&nbsp; They are not particular as to the qualifications of the 
men they ship as &ldquo;able-bodied and thorough seamen.&rdquo;&nbsp; They 
sometimes abduct men who have never trod the deck of a ship <!-- page 
785--><a name="page785"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
785</span>before.&nbsp; During the war the notorious Thomas Hadden, of 374 
Water street, induced a poor tailor to go on board of a ship by telling him
that the crew wanted their clothes mended, and assured him that the 
&ldquo;job&rdquo; would give him employment for several days, and amply 
repay him for his trouble.&nbsp; The tailor, upon going on board, was at 
once set to work in the forecastle on a lot of dilapidated jackets, and Mr.
Hadden at once went ashore.&nbsp; Immediately the cables were cast off, and
the ship was towed out into the stream by a tug which had been held in 
readiness.&nbsp; The unsuspecting tailor continued his work, never noticing
the motion of the ship, and it was not until she had crossed the bar, and 
gotten to sea, that he was aroused by the rough voice of the mate, 
commanding him to go to his duty on deck.&nbsp; Then, to his horror, he 
found that he was on his way to Canton.&nbsp; He returned, after a voyage 
of two years, and at once took measures to bring Hadden to justice.&nbsp; 
The wretch escaped, however, and was not seen again in Water street for 
three years.&nbsp; Mr. Hadden is now serving out a term of ten years 
imprisonment in the New Jersey Penitentiary, for grand larceny.</p>
<p>Usually, however, &ldquo;Shanghaiing&rdquo; is practised upon drunken 
sailors only.&nbsp; They are made drunk, as has been stated, immediately 
after the discovery of the loss of their wages, and are kept so until an 
opportunity presents itself for sending them to sea.&nbsp; Thus they are 
gotten rid of, care being taken to ship them only on voyages of two and 
three years duration.&nbsp; The landlords receive a premium on the men 
furnished by them.&nbsp; They also make out fictitious claims against the 
poor fellows, and pocket the three months&rsquo; wages advanced by the 
owners or masters of the vessels on which the unfortunates are shipped.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p786.jpg">
<img alt="NEW YORK SEAMEN&rsquo;S EXCHANGE BUILDING." src="images/p786.jpg"
/>
</a></p>
<p>Thus the sailor is plundered, made drunk, prevented from enjoying any 
other society on shore but that of thieves and the lowest 
prostitutes.&nbsp; It frequently happens that the poor fellow never 
receives the benefit of a single penny of his earnings, and never spends 
more than a week or ten days ashore between his voyages.&nbsp; Efforts have
been made by conscientious ship-owners to put a stop to the outrages of the
landlords, but each one has failed.&nbsp; The wretches have banded 
together, and have prevented <!-- page 787--><a name="page787"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 787</span>sailors from shipping, and in the end the 
ship-owners have been compelled to abandon the sailor to the mercy of his 
tyrants.&nbsp; Only a law of Congress, regulating sailors&rsquo; boarding 
houses, according to the system now in use in England, will remedy the 
evil.&nbsp; Efforts are now being made to secure the passage, during the 
present session of Congress, of a bill, entitled the &ldquo;Shipping 
Commissioners&rsquo; Bill,&rdquo; which has received the sanction of the 
shipping merchants of New York, and which will effectually remedy the evils
we have described.</p>
<p>The merchants of the city have also organized a &ldquo;Seamen&rsquo;s 
Exchange,&rdquo; the objects of which are thus set forth by the 
Association:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The objects of this Association shall be the moral, mental, and 
social improvement of seamen, to elevate their character and efficiency as 
a class, and to protect them from impositions and abuses at home and 
abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To build up such an organization of respectable seamen as will 
command the respect of the community, enable ship-owners to protect 
themselves from the imposition of worthless and disorderly characters 
claiming to be seamen, but disgracing the name, and secure for their 
vessels reliable and efficient crews; while at the same time the seaman 
will be enabled to select good ships and good officers, and thus secure 
good treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They propose to attain these objects by the adoption of the following 
measures:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To provide an exchange, reading-room, library, and savings-bank 
which shall be open to all seamen on the payment of a small annual 
subscription.&nbsp; To issue certificates of membership, and of character 
and capacity.&nbsp; To assert and maintain perfect liberty in the selection
of boarding-houses, shipping-offices, and voyages.&nbsp; To refuse to pay 
or to receive &lsquo;bonus-money&rsquo; for ships, or 
&lsquo;blood-money&rsquo; for men, by which custom both shipowners and 
seamen are sufferers.&nbsp; To supply vessels with crews without the 
intervention of any shipping-master should it become necessary.&nbsp; To 
discourage the system of advanced wages as the source of many evils and but
few benefits.&nbsp; To keep a record of the name, age, character, and 
capacity, so far as can be <!-- page 788--><a name="page788"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 788</span>ascertained, of every member of this 
Association; also, of the vessels in port, their class, owners or agents, 
and the voyages on which they are bound.&nbsp; To establish means by which 
seamen can receive afternoon and evening lessons in the common English 
branches and navigation.&nbsp; To encourage and assist every sailor in his 
efforts to improve his character and to save his hard-earned money for the 
benefit of himself and his family, and on all suitable occasions to give 
him such advice and information as his circumstances may seem to 
require.&rdquo;</p>

789</span>LXXVI.&nbsp; THE BALLET.</h2>
<p>The ballet seems at last to have found a home in New York, and to have 
become one of the permanent institutions of the great city,&mdash;witness 
the triumphs of the Black Crook, of Humpty Dumpty, and the spectacular 
plays of the Grand Opera House.&nbsp; It must be confessed that it is well 
done here.&nbsp; The Black Crook carries off the palm.&nbsp; Its ballets 
are the best arranged and the best executed, and its dancers are as good 
looking and attractive as ballet girls ever are.</p>
<p>There are several hundred girls and women in New York who earn their 
living by dancing in the ballets of the various theatres.&nbsp; The Black 
Crook alone employs about one hundred.&nbsp; Those who have seen these 
damsels in their glory, in the full glare of the foot and calcium lights, 
amidst the most gorgeous surroundings, and under the influence of delicious
music, may have come to the conclusion that such a life must be very 
pleasant.&nbsp; They little know the experience of a ballet girl.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard life,&rdquo; said one of them, not long since, 
&ldquo;and very little fun in it, if you&rsquo;re decent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ballet girl always appears on the bills as a miss, but some of them 
are married, and have to support helpless or worthless husbands.&nbsp; They
are of all nationalities.&nbsp; The Premi&egrave;res are generally French 
or Italian&mdash;at least on the bills.&nbsp; These are usually excellent 
dancers, and are fond of their art.&nbsp; They are well paid, and as a rule
save their money.&nbsp; Mdlle. Bonafanti received $150 per week from the 
managers of Niblo&rsquo;s Theatre.&nbsp; Mdlle. Morlacchi also receives 
large sums.&nbsp; She is a sensible woman, and has invested her earnings in
a pretty home in New England, where she spends her summers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p790.jpg">
<img alt="THE BALLET." src="images/p790.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Not more <!-- page 791--><a name="page791"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
791</span>than one or two in the same establishment receive such high pay, 
however.&nbsp; The salaries, as a rule, are small.&nbsp; The Secondas at 
Niblo&rsquo;s, the home of the Black Crook, receive from $50 to $100 per 
week.&nbsp; There are twelve coryph&eacute;es who earn from $25 to $30 per 
week.&nbsp; Then follow the first, second, and third lines of the ballet, 
with wages ranging from $5 to $30 per week.&nbsp; The girls who march in 
the processions of female soldiers receive about $8 per week.&nbsp; The 
costumes, armor, etc., are furnished by the theatre, but there are many 
articles of dress which the girls are obliged to furnish at their own 
expense.</p>
<p>The ballet girl rises about eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and is 
off to rehearsal by nine.&nbsp; A duller, more dreary sight than a 
rehearsal of a ballet by daylight, and in plain dress, cannot be 
imagined.&nbsp; The theatre is dark and gloomy, the stage not much lighter,
and everything is in confusion.&nbsp; There is a smell of escaping gas in 
all parts of the building.&nbsp; Scattered about the stage are a number of 
girls and women in half skirts, with fleshings on their legs, and some of 
them with woollen hose drawn over the fleshings to keep them warm.&nbsp; 
They are terribly jaded and hollow eyed, and they seem incapable of being 
interested in anything.&nbsp; A very different set from the smiling, 
graceful houris of the evening before.&nbsp; At a given signal the music 
begins, and the girls commence a series of capers which seem utterly 
ridiculous.&nbsp; It is downright hard work for the girls, however; and 
those who are not engaged in leaping, or pirouetting, or wriggling, are 
leaning against the scenery and panting with fatigue.&nbsp; The leader of 
the ballet storms and swears at them, and is made frantic by every little 
mistake.&nbsp; The rehearsal occupies several hours.&nbsp; If there is a 
matin&eacute;e that day, it is kept up until it is time for the girls to 
dress for that performance.&nbsp; Between the close of the matin&eacute;e, 
and the opening of the evening performance, there is not much time for the 
tired girls to rest.</p>
<p>Upon assembling for the evening performance, the girls are dressed by a 
practical costumer, whose business it is to see that each one wears her 
costume properly.&nbsp; This arranged, they pass down to the 
painter&rsquo;s room, where their cheeks, ears, and nostrils <!-- page 
792--><a name="page792"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 792</span>are 
&ldquo;touched up&rdquo; by an artist.&nbsp; Their hair is dressed by 
another artist, and every defect of face and figure is overcome as far as 
is possible.&nbsp; Thus adorned, the dull and jaded girl of the morning 
becomes, under the magical influence of the footlights, a dazzling sprite, 
and the object of the admiration of the half-grown boys and brainless men 
who crowd the front rows of orchestra seats.</p>
<p>The performance is not over until near midnight.&nbsp; Then the dancer 
must change her dress, fold her stage dress carefully away, make up her 
bundle, and set out for home.&nbsp; The principal dancers, such as 
Bonafanti, and Morlacchi, of course, have an easier time than the ordinary 
ballet girls, but all work hard.</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that the ballet-dancer is of necessity an impure
woman.&nbsp; Too many of them are; but, as a class, they are much 
abused.&nbsp; They work hard, and do not have much leisure time, and 
deserve more sympathy than reproach.&nbsp; Men, especially, think that, 
because they appear on the stage in a state of semi-nudity, they are 
immodest and of easy virtue; and in New York there is a class of men, of 
nominal respectability, who appear to regard ballet-dancers as their 
legitimate prey.&nbsp; They exert all their arts to lead these poor girls 
astray, and are too often successful.&nbsp; There is not a ballet-dancer in
the city but can tell many a tale of persecutions of this kind; and if ever
the devil employed a legion of emissaries to do his work, they must be the 
grinning, leering men who occupy the front seats in the theatres during the
ballet performances, and who spend their leisure time in seeking to compass
the ballet-girl&rsquo;s ruin.</p>
<p>The ballet-girl, says Olive Logan, &ldquo;is a dancer, and loves dancing
as an art.&nbsp; That pose into which she now throws herself with such 
abandon, is not a vile pandering to the tastes of those giggling men in the
orchestra stalls, but is an effort, which, to her idea, is as loving a 
tribute to a beloved art as a painter&rsquo;s dearest pencil touch is to 
him.&nbsp; I have seen these women burst into tears on leaving the stage, 
because they had observed men laughing among themselves, rolling their eyes
about, and <!-- page 793--><a name="page793"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
793</span>evidently making unworthy comments on the pretty creatures before
them, whose whole heart was for the hour lovingly given over to 
Terpsichore.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is <i>they</i> who are bad,&rsquo; said Mdlle.
B--- to me, the other night; &lsquo;it is not we.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The majority of the ballet-dancers dwell with their parents, but many of
those in the upper ranks of the profession like the freedom of Bleecker 
street, and reside in that thoroughfare.&nbsp; Thompson street also 
contains several boarding-houses patronized by dancers and burlesque 
actresses.&nbsp; A writer in the New York <i>World</i> gives the following 
clever sketch of the more prosperous ballet-girl at home:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was strictly a theatrical boarding-house, and all the young 
ladies were dancers.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would never do to have anybody else 
here.&nbsp; Mrs. Sullivan is Miss Jones&rsquo;s dresser at the 
&ldquo;Adelphi,&rdquo; and she has kept house here some years.&nbsp; Her 
husband was an actor, and he went to California and never came back.&nbsp; 
She&rsquo;s a dear good woman, and treats us like her daughters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many of you board here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thirteen.&nbsp; All of them are high-priced 
dancers&mdash;no ballet and utility girls here.&nbsp; No, <i>sir</i>!&nbsp;
We pay $10 to $15 a week for board.&nbsp; She treats us like her own 
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Bell then suggested a tour of the house, offering to be the 
guide of such an exploration.&nbsp; Tripping down stairs with the elastic 
hop of a bird, she knocked at the door of the lower front chamber, and 
immediately ushered her companion into the room.&nbsp; It was large and 
elegant, and in exquisite order.&nbsp; One really beautiful girl was 
driving a sewing-machine before a window with the industry of a 
seamstress.&nbsp; Another was engaged in trimming a tiny pair of satin 
boots with beads of every color.&nbsp; She was short, small, and swarthy, 
her chief beauty being a languishing pair of black eyes.&nbsp; A third lay 
at full length on a small bed in an alcove, reading <i>Harper&rsquo;s 
Bazaar</i> with the avidity of a milliner, or a lady of fashion.&nbsp; She 
was exceedingly pretty and ladylike.&nbsp; Two of them wore the inevitable 
white wrapper, while the third was fully dressed in a simple gray 
walking-suit.&nbsp; The lovely creature at the <!-- page 794--><a 
name="page794"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 794</span>sewing-machine was 
Miss Ethel Lynn of the &lsquo;Lyceum;&rsquo; the swarthy girl was Miss 
Lottie Taylor of the &lsquo;Gaiety,&rsquo; and the third was another Miss 
Lynn, pseudo-sister of Ethel, with whom she &lsquo;worked,&rsquo; but in 
reality a no-relation named Ellis.&nbsp; The three girls smiled prettily 
enough on learning their visitor&rsquo;s object, and the recumbent beauty 
regretted that it was impossible, under the circumstances, to publish a 
picture of the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next room was occupied by &lsquo;a very great swell,&rsquo; 
the premi&egrave;re danseuse of the &lsquo;Lyceum&rsquo;.&nbsp; It 
contained a superb piano littered with stage properties, dresses, and 
general odds and ends.&nbsp; The furniture was of splendid quality, and 
large tinted photographs of prominent French &lsquo;professionals,&rsquo; 
including an unusually prepossessing likeness of Schneider, decked the 
walls.&nbsp; Satin tights, exquisitely pink, hung out of a half-open 
trunk.&nbsp; The danseuse was seated at a small table, her own profuse 
golden hair coiled after an indolent fashion, while her diamonded fingers 
were hard at work saturating some superb yellow tresses in a saucerful of 
colorless fluid, a bleaching agent for continuing the lustre of blond 
hair.&nbsp; A clamorous parrot trolled a bar or two of <i>&lsquo;Un Mari 
Sage&rsquo;</i> overhead, and a shaggy poodle lay couched in leonine 
fashion at her feet, munching a handsome though fractured fan.&nbsp; A 
well-directed kick of her dainty little slippered foot sent the 
sacrilegious animal flying on the entrance of the two invaders.&nbsp; This 
was Mademoiselle Helene Devereux, a young lady who twirled her toes for a 
salary scarcely less than that of the President of the United States.&nbsp;
French by birth, she spoke English with a pure accent.&nbsp; She seemed 
much amused at the errand of her masculine visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to see a <i>premi&egrave;re</i> at home?&nbsp; Look at 
me now, dyeing my own hair.&nbsp; And see that dress there.&nbsp; I made it
every bit myself.&nbsp; I get up every morning at 8.&nbsp; Some of the 
other lazy things in the house never think of breakfast till 10.&nbsp; But 
I turn out at 8; eat some breakfast; do all my mending; sort out my 
washing; go to rehearsal; practise new dances; come home to lunch; drive 
out to the Park; eat my dinner; go to the theatre; eat my supper, and go 
straight to bed.&nbsp; Can anybody live more properly?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t 
think it possible.&nbsp; Mrs. <!-- page 795--><a name="page795"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 795</span>Sullivan says I&rsquo;m a model.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t give her the least bit of trouble, and she wouldn&rsquo;t part 
with me for anything.&nbsp; You ought to have been here just now, and seen 
little Vulfi of the &ldquo;Melodeon.&rdquo;&nbsp; She makes $100 a night, 
and yet she doesn&rsquo;t dress any more stylishly than Mrs. Sullivan; and 
she never bought a jewel in her life.&nbsp; She supports a mother, and 
sends a brother to college in Florence.&nbsp; You people think we are 
fast.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all nonsense.&nbsp; It is only the little dancers,
<i>la canaille</i>, who can afford to be dissipated.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t, I
know that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m too tired after the theatre to think of going 
out on a spree, as they call it.&nbsp; Besides, it doesn&rsquo;t do for a 
dancer to be too cheap.&nbsp; It hurts her business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Devereux&rsquo;s nice, isn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; said Miss 
Bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s very good, and she&rsquo;s plucky.&nbsp; A 
fellow once followed her home from rehearsal, chirping to her all the 
way.&nbsp; She said nothing, but went right on into the livery stable next 
door.&nbsp; The fellow went in after her, and she snatched a carriage whip 
out of the office, and, oh my! didn&rsquo;t she thrash him?&nbsp; Nobody 
interfered, and she whipped him till her arm ached.&nbsp; Ever since then 
she&rsquo;s been receiving dreadful letters, and so has Mrs. 
Sullivan.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t find out who sends them, and she&rsquo;s 
never seen the fellow again.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

796</span>LXXVII.&nbsp; THE POOR OF NEW YORK.</h2>
<h3>I.&nbsp; THE DESERVING POOR.</h3>
<p>Poverty is a terrible misfortune in any city.&nbsp; In New York it is 
frequently regarded as a crime.&nbsp; But whether the one or the other, it 
assumes here proportions which it does not reach in other American 
communities.&nbsp; The city is overrun with those who are classed as 
paupers, and in spite of the great efforts made to relieve them, their 
suffering is very great.</p>
<p>The deserving poor are numerous.&nbsp; They have been brought to their 
sad condition by misfortune.&nbsp; A laboring man may die and leave a widow
with a number of small children dependent on her exertions.&nbsp; The lot 
of such is very hard.&nbsp; Sickness may strike down a father or mother, 
and thus deprive the remaining members of a family of their accustomed 
support, or men and women may be thrown out of work suddenly, or may be 
unable to procure employment.&nbsp; Again, a man may bring himself and his 
family to want by drunkenness.&nbsp; If the children are too young to earn 
their bread, the support of the family falls upon the wife.&nbsp; Whatever 
may be the cause of the misfortune, the lot of the poor in New York is very
hard.&nbsp; Their homes are the most wretched tenement houses, and they are
compelled to dwell among the most abandoned and criminal part of the 
population.&nbsp; No wonder poverty is so much dreaded here.&nbsp; The poor
man has little, if any, chance of bettering his condition, and he is 
gradually forced down lower and lower in the scale of misery, until death

798</span>The Missionaries are constant in their labors among the 
poor.&nbsp; They shrink from no work, are deterred by no danger, but carry 
their spiritual and temporal relief into places from which the dainty 
pastors of fashionable churches shrink with disgust.&nbsp; They not only 
preach the Gospel to the poor, who would never hear it but for them, but 
they watch by the bed-sides of the sick and the dying, administer the last 
rites of religion to the believing pauper or the penitent criminal, and 
offer to the Great Judge the only appeal for mercy that is ever made in 
behalf of many a soul that dies in its sins.&nbsp; There is many a wretched
home into which these men have carried the only joy that has ever entered 
its doors.&nbsp; Nor are they all men, for many of the most effective 
Missionaries are gentle and daintily nurtured women.&nbsp; A part of the 
Missionary&rsquo;s work is to distribute Bibles, tracts, and simple 
religious instruction.&nbsp; These are simple little documents, but they do
a deal of good.&nbsp; They have reformed drunkards, converted the 
irreligious, shut the mouth of the swearer, and have brought peace to more 
than one heart.&nbsp; The work is done so silently and unpretendingly that 
few but those engaged in it know how great are its effects.&nbsp; They are 
encouraged by the evidences which they have, and continue their work 
gladly.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Missionaries, many of the deserving poor have been brought
under the constant care of the Mission Establishments, from which they 
receive the assistance they need.&nbsp; Yet there are many who cannot be 
reached, or at least cannot be aided effectively.&nbsp; The officers of the
Howard Mission relate many touching incidents of the suffering that has 
come under their notice.</p>
<p>There was among the inmates of the Mission, about a year ago, a girl 
named Rose ---.&nbsp; She was ten years old, and was so lame that she was 
unable to walk without crutches.&nbsp; When she became old enough to do 
anything, her mother, a drunken and depraved woman, sent her on the streets
to sweep the crossings and beg.&nbsp; She managed to secure a little money,
which she invested in &ldquo;songs.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paid three-quarters of
a cent for each &ldquo;song,&rdquo; and sold them at a cent apiece.&nbsp; 
With <!-- page 799--><a name="page799"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
799</span>her earnings she supported her mother.&nbsp; Their home was the 
back room of a cellar, into which no light ever shone, and their bed was a 
pile of rags.&nbsp; To reach this wretched spot, the little girl was 
compelled to pass through the front cellar, which was one of the vilest and
most disgusting dens in the city.</p>
<p>The mother at length fell ill, and the child in despair applied to the 
Howard Mission for aid, which she received.&nbsp; Food and clothing were 
given to the mother, but they were of little use to her, as she died within
two days.&nbsp; The breath had scarcely left her body, when the wretches 
who occupied the outer cellar stripped her of all her clothing, and left 
her naked.&nbsp; She was wrapped in an old sheet, put into a pine box, 
nailed up and buried in the potter&rsquo;s field, without the pretence of a
funeral.</p>
<p>The little girl, now left alone, succeeded in obtaining some 
sewing.&nbsp; She worked on one occasion from Tuesday until Saturday, 
making eleven dozen leaves for trimming ladies&rsquo; velvet cloaks.&nbsp; 
She furnished her own thread, and paid her own car fare.&nbsp; She received
eight cents a dozen for the leaves, or eighty-eight cents in all, or less 
than the thread and car fare had actually cost her.&nbsp; The officers of 
the Howard Mission now came to her aid, and gave her a home in their 
blessed haven of rest.</p>
<p>One of the evening papers, about a year ago, contained the following 
&ldquo;Incident of City Life:&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a cellar, No. 91 Cherry street, we found an Irish woman with 
five children, the oldest probably ten years old.&nbsp; Her husband had 
been out of work for nearly six months, and was suffering severely from 
bronchitis.&nbsp; There was no appearance of liquor about the place, and 
the Missionary who had visited them often said she was sure they did not 
drink.&nbsp; The woman was suffering severely from heart disease, and had a
baby three weeks old.&nbsp; But what a place for a baby!&nbsp; There were 
two windows, two feet by two feet, next to the street, so splashed on the 
outside and stained by the dust and mud that they admitted but little 
light.&nbsp; A tidy housewife might say, Why don&rsquo;t the woman wash 
them?&nbsp; How can she stop to wash windows, with a baby three weeks old 
and four helpless little ones besides, crying around her with hunger and 
cold?&nbsp; The floor had no <!-- page 800--><a name="page800"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 800</span>carpet.&nbsp; An old stove, which would not 
draw on account of some defect in the chimney of the house, had from time 
to time spread its clouds of smoke through the cellar&mdash;the only 
room&mdash;even when the baby was born.&nbsp; A few kettles, etc., stood 
around the floor, some crumbs of bread were on a shelf, but no sign of meat
or vegetables.&nbsp; A wash-tub, containing half-washed clothing, stood 
near the middle of the room; there was a table, and <!-- page 801--><a 
name="page801"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 801</span>a bedstead stood in a
corner pretty well furnished&mdash;the bed clothing the gift of 
charity.&nbsp; In this the father, mother, babe, and perhaps a little boy 
two years old, slept.&nbsp; But the other children?&nbsp; O, they had some 
old bundles of rags on the floor, and here they were compelled to lie like 
pigs, with little or nothing to cover them.&nbsp; When it rained, the water
from the street poured into this hole, and saturated the rags on which the 
children slept, and they had to lie there like poor little drowned rats, 
shivering and wailing till morning came, when they could go out and gather 
cinders enough to make a fire.&nbsp; The privilege of living in this place 
cost five dollars per month.&nbsp; And yet this woman was willing to talk 
about God, and believed in his goodness.&nbsp; She believed that he often 
visited that place.&nbsp; Yes, he does go down there when the good Miss ---
from the Mission descends the slimy steps.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p> &ldquo;I have been astounded,&rdquo; said a city clergyman to the 
writer, &ldquo;to find so much genuine piety in the wretched places I 
visit.&nbsp; A few nights ago I was called to see a woman who was very 
ill.&nbsp; The messenger conducted me to a miserable cellar, where, on a 
bed of rags, I found a woman, about sixty years old, gasping for 
breath.&nbsp; She greeted me with feverish anxiety, and asked me if I 
thought it possible for her to get well; I told her I did not know, and as 
she seemed very ill, I sent the man who had been my conductor, to the 
nearest police station, to ask for medical aid.&nbsp; I asked her if she 
wished to live, she answered, &lsquo;No, unless it be God&rsquo;s will that
I should.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, the reply startled me, for the tone was one of
unquestioned resignation, and I had not expected to discover that virtue 
here.&nbsp; In reply to my questions she told me her story&mdash;a very 
common one&mdash;of a long life of bitter poverty, following close on a few
years of happiness and comfort at the beginning of her womanhood.&nbsp; Her
trial had been very hard, but she managed by God&rsquo;s grace to keep her 
soul pure and her conscience free from reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a little while the physician I had sent for came in.&nbsp; He 
saw her condition at a glance, and turning to me said, in a low tone, that 
she would not live through the night, that she was <!-- page 802--><a 
name="page802"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 802</span>literally worn 
out.&nbsp; As low as he spoke, she overheard him.&nbsp; She clasped her 
bony hands exultantly, her poor wan face gleamed with joy, and she burst 
out in her thin, weak voice, into the words of the hymn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Happy soul! thy days are ended,<br />
&nbsp;  Leave thy trials here below:<br />
Go, by angel guards attended,<br />
&nbsp;  To the breast of Jesus, go!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she died that night, and I am sure she is in heaven 
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great efforts are made by the organized charities of the city to relieve
the sufferings of the deserving poor.&nbsp; Prominent among these charities
is the &ldquo;Association for Improving the Condition of the 
Poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The object of the Society is to help them by enabling 
them to help themselves and gradually to lift them up out of the depths of 
poverty.&nbsp; The city is divided into small districts, each of which is 
in charge of a visitor, whose duty it is to seek out the deserving 
poor.&nbsp; All the assistance is given through these visitors, and nothing
is done, except in extreme cases, until the true condition of the applicant
is ascertained.&nbsp; Money is never given, and only such supplies as are 
not likely to be improperly used.&nbsp; Every recipient of the bounty of 
the Society is required to abstain from intoxicating liquors, to send young
children to school, and to apprentice those of a suitable age.&nbsp; During
the twenty-seven years of its existence, ending October 1st, 1870, the 
Society has expended in charities the sum of $1,203,767, and has given 
relief to 180,000 families, or 765,000 persons.&nbsp; The office of the 
Society is in the Bible House.</p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; THE BEGGARS.</h3>
<p>Begging is a profession in New York.&nbsp; The deserving poor rarely 
come on the streets to seek aid, but the beggars crowd them, as they know 
the charitable institutions of the city would <!-- page 803--><a 
name="page803"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 803</span>at once detect their 
imposture.&nbsp; A short while ago the &ldquo;Superintendent of the 
Out-door Poor,&rdquo; said to a city merchant, &ldquo;As a rule never give 
alms to a street beggar.&nbsp; Send them to me when they accost you, and 
not one in fifty will dare to show his face in my office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New York beggars are mainly foreigners.&nbsp; Scarcely an American 
is seen on the streets in this capacity.&nbsp; Every year the number is 
increasing.&nbsp; Foreigners who were professional beggars in their own 
countries, are coming over here to practise their trades, and these make 
New York their headquarters.&nbsp; It is estimated that there are more 
professional beggars here than in all the other cities of the country 
combined.</p>
<p>Broadway, and especially Fourteenth street, Union Square, and the Fifth 
avenue are full of them.&nbsp; They represent all forms of physical 
misfortune.&nbsp; Some appear to have but one leg, others but one 
arm.&nbsp; Some are blind, others horribly deformed.&nbsp; Some are genuine
cripples, but the majority are sound in body.&nbsp; They beg because the 
business is profitable, and they are too lazy to work.&nbsp; The greater 
the semblance of distress, the more lucrative is their profession.&nbsp; 
Women hire babies, and post themselves in the thoroughfares most frequented
by ladies.&nbsp; They generally receive a considerable sum during the 
course of the day.&nbsp; Others again provide themselves with a basket, in 
which they place a wretched display of shoestrings which no one is expected
to buy, and station themselves in Broadway to attract the attention of the 
charitably disposed.&nbsp; The most daring force their way into private 
houses and the hotels and demand assistance with the most brazen 
effrontery.&nbsp; They hang on to you with the utmost determination, 
exposing the most disgusting sights to your gaze, and annoying you so much 
that you give them money in order to be rid of them.&nbsp; They, in their 
turn, mark you well, and remember you when you pass them again.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most annoying of the street beggars are the children.&nbsp; 
They frequent all parts of the city, but literally infest Fourteenth street
and the lower part of the Fifth avenue.&nbsp; Many of them are driven into 
the streets by their parents to beg.&nbsp; They have the most pitiful tales
to tell if you will listen <!-- page 804--><a name="page804"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 804</span>to them.&nbsp; There is one little girl who 
frequents Fourteenth street, whose &ldquo;mother has just died and left 
seven small children,&rdquo; every day in the last two years.&nbsp; A 
gentleman was once accosted by two of these children, whose feet were bare,
although the weather was very cold.&nbsp; Seizing each by the arm, he 
ordered them to put on their shoes and stockings.&nbsp; His manner was so 
positive that they at once sat down on a door step, and producing their 
shoes and stockings from beneath their shawls, put them on.&nbsp; Many of 
these children support drunken or depraved parents by begging, and are 
soundly beaten by them if they return home at night without money.&nbsp; 
They grow up to a life of vagrancy.&nbsp; They soon learn to cheat and 
steal, and from such offences they pass rapidly into prostitution and 
crime.</p>
<p>Besides these street beggars, there are numbers of genteel, and 
doubtless well-meaning persons who make it their business to beg for 
others.&nbsp; They intrude upon you at the most inconvenient times, and 
venture into your private apartments with a freedom and assurance which 
positively amaze you.&nbsp; Refuse them, and they are insulting.</p>
<p>Then there are those who approach you by means of letters.&nbsp; They 
send you the most pitiful appeals for aid, and assure you that nothing but 
the direst necessity induces them to send you such a letter, and that they 
would not do so under any circumstances, were not they aware of your 
well-known charitable disposition.&nbsp; Some persons of known wealth 
receive as many as a dozen letters of this kind each day.&nbsp; They are, 
in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, from impostors, and are properly 
consigned to the waste-basket.</p>
<p>Housekeepers have frequent applications every day for food.&nbsp; These 
are generally complied with, as, in all families of moderate size, there is
much that must either be given or thrown away.&nbsp; Children and old 
people generally do this kind of begging.&nbsp; They come with long faces 
and pitiful voices, and ask for food in the most doleful tones.&nbsp; Grant
their requests, and you will be amused at the cool manner in which they 
will produce large baskets, filled with provisions, and deposit your gift 
therein.&nbsp; Many Irish families find all their provisions in this 
way.</p>

805</span>LXXVIII.&nbsp; QUACK DOCTORS.</h2>
<p>Carlyle&rsquo;s savage description of the people of 
England&mdash;&ldquo;Eighteen millions of inhabitants, mostly 
fools&rdquo;&mdash;is not applicable to his countrymen alone.&nbsp; It may 
be regarded as descriptive of the world at large, if the credulity, or to 
use a more expressive term, &ldquo;the gullibility&rdquo; of men is to be 
taken as a proof that they are &ldquo;fools.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many years ago a 
sharp-witted scamp appeared in one of the European countries, and offered 
for sale a pill which he declared to be a sure protection <i>against 
earthquakes</i>.&nbsp; Absurd as was the assertion, he sold large 
quantities of his nostrum and grew rich upon the proceeds.&nbsp; The 
credulity which enriched this man is still a marked characteristic of the 
human race, and often strikingly exhibits itself in this country.&nbsp; 
During the present winter a rumor went out that a certain holy woman, 
highly venerated by the Roman Catholic Church, had predicted on her 
death-bed, that during the month of February, 1872, there would be three 
days of intense darkness over the world, in which many persons would 
perish, and that this darkness would be so intense that no light but that 
of a candle blessed by the Church could penetrate it.&nbsp; A Roman 
Catholic newspaper in Philadelphia ventured to print this prophecy, and 
immediately the rush for consecrated candles was so great on the part of 
the more ignorant members of that Church, that the Bishop of the Diocese 
felt himself obliged to publicly rebuke the superstition.&nbsp; This 
credulity manifests itself in nearly every form of life.&nbsp; The quack 
doctors or medical impostors, to whom we shall devote this chapter, live 
upon it, and do all in their power to encourage it.</p>
<p>There are quite a number of these men in New York.&nbsp; They <!-- page 
806--><a name="page806"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 806</span>offer to 
cure all manner of diseases, some for a small and others for a large 
sum.&nbsp; It has been discovered that some of these men carry on their 
business under two or three different names, often thus securing a double 
or triple share of their wretched business.&nbsp; The newspapers are full 
of their advertisements, many of which are unfit for the columns of a 
reputable journal.&nbsp; They cover the dead walls of the city with hideous
pictures of disease and suffering, and flood the country with circulars and
pamphlets setting forth the horrors of certain diseases, and giving an 
elaborate description of the symptoms by which they may be 
recognized.&nbsp; A clever physician has said that no man ever undertakes 
to look for defects in his physical system without finding them.&nbsp; The 
truth of the remark is proven by the fact that a very large number of 
persons, reading these descriptions of symptoms, many of which symptoms are
common to a number of ills, come to the conclusion that they are affected 
in the manner stated by the quack.&nbsp; Great is the power of the 
imagination! so great, indeed, that many sound, healthy men are thus led to
fancy themselves in need of medical attention.&nbsp; A short interview with
some reputable physician would soon undeceive them, but they lay aside 
their good sense, and fall victims to their credulity.&nbsp; They think 
that as the quack has shown them where their trouble lies, he must needs 
have the power of curing them.&nbsp; They send their money to the author of
the circular in question, and request a quantity of his medicine for the 
purpose of trying it.&nbsp; The nostrum is received in due time, and is 
accompanied by a second circular, in which the patient is coolly informed 
that he must not expect to be cured by one bottle, box, or package, as the 
case may be, but that five or six, or sometimes a dozen will be necessary 
to complete the cure, especially if the case is as desperate and stubborn 
as the letter applying for the medicine seems to indicate.&nbsp; Many are 
foolish enough to take the whole half dozen bottles or packages, and in the
end are no better in health than they were at first.&nbsp; Indeed they are 
fortunate if they are not seriously injured by the doses they have 
taken.&nbsp; They are disheartened in nine cases out of ten, and are, at 
length, really in need of good medical advice.&nbsp; They have paid the 
<!-- page 807--><a name="page807"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
807</span>quack more money than a good practitioner would demand for his 
services, and have only been injured by their folly.</p>
<p>It may be safely said that no honest and competent physician will 
undertake to treat cases by letter.&nbsp; <i>No one worthy of patronage 
will guarantee a cure in any case</i>, for an educated practitioner 
understands that cases are many and frequent where the best human skill may
be exerted in vain.&nbsp; Further than this, a physician of merit will not 
advertise himself in the newspapers, except to announce the location of his
office or residence.&nbsp; Such physicians are jealous of their personal 
and professional reputations, and are proud of their calling, which is 
justly esteemed one of the noblest on earth.&nbsp; They are men of 
humanity, and learning, and they take more pleasure in relieving suffering 
than in making money.&nbsp; To those who have no money they give their 
services in the name of the Great Healer of all ills.&nbsp; They have no 
private remedies.&nbsp; Their knowledge is freely given to the scientific 
world that all men may be benefited by it, contenting themselves with the 
enjoyments of the fame of their discoveries.</p>
<p>The quack, however, is a different being.&nbsp; In some cases he has 
medical knowledge, in the majority of instances he is an ignoramus.&nbsp; 
His sole object is to make money, and he sells remedies which he knows to 
be worthless, and even vends drugs which he is sure will do positive harm 
in the majority of cases.</p>
<p>The best plan is never to answer a medical advertisement.&nbsp; There 
are regular physicians enough in the land, and if one is influenced by 
motives of economy, he is pursuing a mistaken course in dealing with the 
advertising quack doctors of New York.&nbsp; If there is real trouble, so 
much the greater is the need of the advice of an educated and conscientious
physician.&nbsp; If concealment is desired, the patient is safe in the 
confidential relations which every honest physician observes towards those 
under his care.&nbsp; A man is simply a fool to swallow drugs or compounds 
of whose nature he is ignorant, or to subject himself to treatment at the 
hands of one who has no personal knowledge of his case.</p>
<p>The same credulity which makes the fortunes of quack <!-- page 808--><a 
name="page808"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 808</span>doctors, enriches the
vendors of &ldquo;Patent Medicines.&rdquo;&nbsp; The majority of the 
&ldquo;specifics,&rdquo; &ldquo;panaceas,&rdquo; etc., advertised in the 
newspapers are humbugs.&nbsp; They are generally made of drugs which can do
no good, even if they do no harm.&nbsp; Some are made of dangerous chemical
substances, and nearly all contain articles which the majority of people 
are apt to abuse.&nbsp; The remedies advertised as cures for &ldquo;private
diseases&rdquo; generally do nothing but keep the complaint at a fixed 
stage, and give it an opportunity to become chronic.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;Elixirs of Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Life Rejuvenators,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Vital Fluids,&rdquo; and other compounds sold to &ldquo;revive worn 
out constitutions&rdquo; are either dangerous poisons or worthless 
draughts.&nbsp; A prominent dealer in drugs once said to the writer that 
the progress of a certain &ldquo;Bitters&rdquo; could be traced across the 
continent, from Chicago to California &ldquo;by the graves it had 
made.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bitters, &ldquo;medicinal wines&rdquo; and such liquors 
have no virtues worth speaking of.&nbsp; They either ruin the tone of the 
stomach, or produce habits of intemperance.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;washes,&rdquo; &ldquo;lotions,&rdquo; &ldquo;toilet 
fluids,&rdquo; etc., are generally apt to produce skin diseases.&nbsp; They
contain, in almost every instance, substances which are either directly or 
indirectly poisonous to the skin.&nbsp; The &ldquo;tooth washes,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;powders,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dentifrices,&rdquo; are hurtful.&nbsp; 
They crack or wear away the enamel of the teeth, leave the nerve exposed, 
and cause the teeth to decay.&nbsp; If you are wise, dear reader, you will 
never use a dentifrice, unless you know what it is made of.&nbsp; The 
principal constituent of these dentifrices is a powerful acid, and there 
are some which contain large quantities of sulphuric acid, one single 
application of which will destroy the best teeth in the world.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;hair dyes,&rdquo; advertised under so many different names, contain 
such poisons as nitrate of silver, oxide of lead, acetate of lead, and 
sulphate of copper.&nbsp; These are fatal to the hair, and generally injure
the scalp.&nbsp; The &ldquo;ointments&rdquo; and &ldquo;unguents,&rdquo; 
for promoting the growth of whiskers and moustaches, are either perfumed 
and colored lard, or poisonous compounds, which contain quick lime, or 
corrosive sublimate, or some kindred substance.&nbsp; If you have any 
acquaintance who has ever used this means of covering his face with a manly
<!-- page 809--><a name="page809"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
809</span>down, ask him which came first, the beard, or a troublesome 
eruption on the face.</p>
<p>Dr. Harris, the recent Superintendent of the Board of Health of New 
York, has frequently pointed out the evils resulting from the use of these 
compounds.&nbsp; Dr. Sayre mentions several cases of fatal poisoning by the
use of hair dye, which came under his notice.</p>
<p>The newspapers frequently contain such advertisements as the 
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A RETIRED PHYSICIAN, OF FORTY YEARS&rsquo; practice, discovered, while 
in India, a sure remedy for consumption, bronchitis, colds, etc.&nbsp; 
Having relinquished his practice, he has no further use for the remedy, and
will send it free on receipt of a three cent stamp to pay return 
postage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the advertiser is &ldquo;A lady who has been cured of great 
nervous debility after many years of misery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, the 
advertiser is a &ldquo;Retired clergyman,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Sufferer 
restored to health, and anxious to benefit his fellow men.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 
whatever form the announcement is made, the advertiser is usually one and 
the same person&mdash;an ignorant knave, who lives by his wits.&nbsp; He 
advertises largely in all parts of the land, spending thousands of dollars 
annually, and it would seem that even an idiot could understand that the 
most benevolent person could not afford so expensive a method of 
&ldquo;benefiting his fellow men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Letters come to him by the 
hundred, from simpletons who have &ldquo;taken his bait,&rdquo; asking for 
his valuable recipe.&nbsp; He sends the prescription, and notifies the 
party asking for it, that if the articles named in it cannot be procured by
him at any drug store convenient to him, he, the &ldquo;retired 
physician,&rdquo; &ldquo;clergyman,&rdquo; or &ldquo;nervous lady,&rdquo; 
will furnish them, upon application, at a certain sum (generally averaging 
five dollars), which he assures him is very cheap, as the drugs are rare 
and expensive.&nbsp; The articles named in the prescription are utterly 
unknown to any druggist in the world, and the names are the production of 
the quack&rsquo;s own brains, and, as a matter of course, the patient is 
unable to procure them at home, and sends an order for them with the <!-- 
page 810--><a name="page810"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 810</span>price, 
to the &ldquo;retired physician,&rdquo; &ldquo;clergyman,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;nervous lady,&rdquo; and in return receives a nostrum compounded of 
drugs, which any apothecary could have furnished at one half the 
expense.&nbsp; In this way the &ldquo;benevolence&rdquo; of the quack is 
very profitable.&nbsp; Men have grown rich in this business, and it is 
carried on to an amazing extent in this city.&nbsp; It is done in violation
of the law, and the benevolent individual not unfrequently falls into the 
hands of the police, but, as soon as released, he opens his business under 
a new name.&nbsp; As long as there are fools and dupes in the world, so 
long will the &ldquo;retired physician&rdquo; find an extensive 
practice.</p>

<p>The letters &ldquo;Y.M.C.A.&rdquo; are familiar to every city and town 
of importance in the Union, and are well known to be the initials of one of
the most praiseworthy organizations in the world.&nbsp; It is needless to 
enter into any general account of the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian 
Association, and I shall devote this chapter to a description of the means 
employed by that body to carry on its work in the metropolis.&nbsp; A 
writer in <i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i> has aptly described the 
headquarters of the Association as a &ldquo;Club House.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;For such it is,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;both in its appliances and 
its purposes, though consecrated neither to politics, as are some, to 
social festivities, degenerating too often into gambling and intemperance, 
as are others, nor to literature and polite society, as are one or two, but
to the cause of good morals, of pure religion, and of Him who is the divine
Inspirer of the one and the divine Founder of the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The building thus referred to is located on the southwest corner of 
Fourth avenue and Twenty-third street, and is one of the handsomest and 
most attractive edifices in the city.&nbsp; The locality is admirably 
chosen.&nbsp; It is in full sight of the Fifth avenue and the neighboring 
hotels, and but one block east of Madison Square.&nbsp; On the opposite 
side of Twenty-third street is the beautiful Academy of Design; diagonally 
opposite is the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and immediately across 
Fourth avenue is the splendid structure of St. Paul&rsquo;s Methodist 
Episcopal Church.&nbsp; It is but three minutes&rsquo; walk from the stages
and cars on Broadway, and two of the most important lines of street cars

<p>The building is five stories in height, and is constructed of dark New 
Jersey sandstone, from the Belleville quarries.&nbsp; It covers about 
one-third of an acre of ground, and has a frontage of one hundred and 
seventy-five feet on Twenty-third street, and eighty-three feet on the 
Fourth avenue.&nbsp; The architecture is of the French Renaissance 
style.&nbsp; The trimmings are of light Ohio stone, but the brown stone 
gives to the building its general aspect.&nbsp; The ground floor is 
occupied by handsome stores, and the fourth and fifth floors are devoted 
chiefly to artists&rsquo; studios.&nbsp; These bring in an annual rental of
about $12,000 or $13,000.</p>
<p>The second and third floors are used exclusively by the 
Association.&nbsp; At the head of the grand stairway which leads from the 
main entrance in Twenty-third street, is a large hall.&nbsp; On the left of
this stairway is the main hall or lecture-room, one <!-- page 813--><a 
name="page813"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 813</span>of the handsomest and
most convenient public halls in the city.&nbsp; At the upper end is a fine 
platform with every convenience for lectures or concerts.&nbsp; The floor 
is provided with iron arm chairs, arranged after the manner of those in the
parquet of Booth&rsquo;s Theatre.&nbsp; A large gallery extends around 
three sides of the hall, and is similarly provided with seats.&nbsp; The 
hall is two stories in height, is beautifully decorated, and will seat with
comfort fifteen hundred people.&nbsp; On one side of the platform is a 
retiring room, and on the other is a large and handsomely decorated 
organ.&nbsp; This is one of the finest instruments in the city, and is a 
novelty in some respects, being furnished with a drum, a triangle, and a 
pair of cymbals.&nbsp; Organ concerts, lectures, and concerts by celebrated
performers are given weekly during the fall and winter.&nbsp; On Sunday, 
religious services are held in the hall, the pastors of the different city 
churches officiating at the invitation of a committee of the Association in
charge of these services.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the main hall is the Reception Room of the 
Association, at one side of which is a door leading into the office of the 
Secretary, who is the executive officer.&nbsp; Adjoining the Reception Room
are the Social Parlors and the Reading Room, in the latter of which the 
leading journals of the country are on file.&nbsp; The parlors are used for
receptions and other social reunions of the members.&nbsp; From the 
Reception Room a flight of stairs leads directly down to the gymnasium and 
bowling-alley, where are to be found all the appliances for the development
of &ldquo;muscular Christianity&rdquo; in its highest form.</p>
<p>On the third floor, which is on a level with the gallery of the Lecture 
Room, are rooms for prayer meetings, Bible classes, and week day classes 
for instruction in modern languages and other studies.&nbsp; Adjoining 
these is a handsome Library Room.&nbsp; The collection of books is 
increasing rapidly, and promises to be both valuable and useful.</p>

<p>Taken altogether, or in detail, the building and all its appointments 
are palatial.&nbsp; It is already the centre of a great and useful work, 
and offers many inducements to young men, especially to those who are 
living in the city, away from their <!-- page 815--><a 
name="page815"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 815</span>homes and families, 
and in the demoralizing atmosphere of the hotels and boarding-houses.&nbsp;
The Association, however, does not content itself with merely offering 
these inducements to those who will seek its doors, but sends its members 
forth into the haunts of suffering and vice, and endeavors to win back 
those who have gone astray from the paths of virtue, and to alleviate the 
misery of those who are in distress.</p>

816</span>LXXX.&nbsp; CASTLE GARDEN.</h2>
<p>Nine-tenths of the emigration from Europe to the United States is 
through the port of New York.&nbsp; In order to accommodate the vast number
of arrivals, the Commissioners of Emigration have established a depot for 
the especial accommodation of this class.</p>
<p>The emigrant ships, both sailing vessels and steamers, anchor in the 
river after entering the port.&nbsp; They generally lie off their own 
piers, and wait for the Custom House boat to board them.&nbsp; As soon as 
this is done, and the necessary forms are gone through with, preparations 
are made to land the emigrants, who, with their baggage, are placed on 
board a small steamer and conveyed to Castle Garden, a round building which
juts out into the water at the upper end of the Battery.</p>
<p>In the year 1807, work was begun on this building by order of the 
General Government, the site having been ceded by the city.&nbsp; It was 
intended to erect a strong fortification, to be called Castle Clinton, but,
in 1820, it was discovered that the foundations were not strong enough to 
bear heavy ordnance, and Congress reconveyed the site to the city.&nbsp; 
The building was then completed as an opera house, and was used for several
years for operatic and theatrical performances, concerts, and public 
receptions.&nbsp; It was the largest and most elegant hall in the country, 
and was the favorite resort of pleasure-seekers.&nbsp; Jenny Lind sang 
there, during her visit to the United States.&nbsp; It was used for public 
amusements until 1825, when, the wealth and fashion of the city having 
removed too high up town to make it profitable, it was leased to the 
Commissioners of Emigration as a landing-place for emigrants.</p>

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 818--><a name="page818"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
818</span>This commission has the exclusive charge of the Landing Depot and
its inmates.&nbsp; It is composed of six Commissioners, appointed by the 
Governor of the State.&nbsp; The Mayors of New York and Brooklyn, and the 
Presidents of the Irish and German Emigrant Societies, are members 
<i>ex-officio</i>.&nbsp; They are responsible to the Legislature for their 
acts.</p>
<p>The Landing Depot is fitted up with quarters for the emigrants and their
baggage, and with various stores at which they can procure articles of 
necessity at moderate prices.&nbsp; As most of them come provided with some
money, there is an exchange office in the enclosure, at which they can 
procure American currency for their foreign money.&nbsp; Many of them come 
furnished with railroad tickets to their destinations in the West, which 
they have purchased in Europe, but the majority buy their tickets in this 
city.&nbsp; There is an office for this purpose in the building, at which 
the agents of the various lines leading from the city to the Great West are
prepared to sell tickets.&nbsp; No one is compelled to transact his 
business in the building, but all are advised to do so, as they will then 
be fairly treated; while they are in danger of falling into the hands of 
swindlers outside.&nbsp; Attached to the establishment is an official, 
whose duty it is to furnish any information desired by the emigrants, and 
to advise them as to the boarding houses of the city which are worthy of 
their patronage.&nbsp; The keepers of these houses are held to a strict 
account of their treatment of their guests.</p>
<p>The majority of the emigrants go West in a few days after their 
arrival.&nbsp; Some have already decided on their place of future abode 
before leaving Europe, and others are influenced by the information they 
receive after reaching this country.&nbsp; Should they desire to remain in 
this city, they are frequently able to obtain employment, through the Labor
Exchange connected with the Landing Depot, and by the same means many 
obtain work in other parts of the country&mdash;the Commissioners taking 
care that the contracts thus made are lawful and fair to both parties.</p>
<p>As we have said, the greater number of the emigrants <!-- page 819--><a 
name="page819"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 819</span>arriving here have 
money when they come.&nbsp; Others, who have been able to raise only enough
to reach this, to them, &ldquo;land of promise,&rdquo; or who have been 
swindled out of their funds by sharpers in European ports, arrive here in 
the most destitute condition.&nbsp; These are a burden to the city and 
State at first, and are at once sent to the Emigrant Refuge and 
Hospital.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p819.jpg">
<img alt="EMIGRANT HOSPITAL." src="images/p819.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This establishment is located on Ward&rsquo;s Island, in the Harlem 
River, and consists of several large buildings for hospitals, nurseries, 
and other purposes.&nbsp; It has a farm of one hundred and six acres 
attached to it.&nbsp; The destitute emigrants are sent to this 
establishment, as soon as their condition is ascertained, and cared for 
until they either obtain employment, or are provided for by their friends 
in this country, or are sent to their original destinations in the West at 
the expense of the Commissioners.&nbsp; Medical attendance is provided at 
the Landing Depot, and is free to all needing it.&nbsp; Serious cases are 
sent to the hospital on Ward&rsquo;s Island, where good medical skill and 
attendance are furnished.</p>
<p>The number of emigrants at the Refuge sometimes amounts to several 
hundred of all nationalities.&nbsp; The Irish and German <!-- page 820--><a
name="page820"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 820</span>elements predominate,
and these being bitterly hostile to each other, the authorities are 
frequently compelled to adopt severe measures to prevent an open collision 
between them.&nbsp; In the winter of 1867-68, the Irish and German 
residents on the island came to blows, and a bloody riot immediately began 
between them, which was only quelled by the prompt arrival of a strong 
force of the City Police.</p>
<p>The Commissioners adopt every means in their power to prevent the 
inmates of the Landing Depot from falling into the hands of sharpers.&nbsp;
Each emigrant in passing out of the enclosure for any purpose is required 
to apply for a permit, without which he cannot return, and no one is 
allowed, by the policeman on duty at the gate, to enter without permission 
from the proper authorities.&nbsp; In this way sharpers and swindlers are 
kept out of the enclosure, inside of which the emigrant is perfectly safe; 
and when he ventures out he is warned of the dangers he will have to 
encounter the moment he passes the gateway.</p>
<p>The majority of the emigrants are unable to speak our language, and all 
are ignorant of the country, its laws, and customs.&nbsp; This makes them 
an easy prey to the villains who throng the Battery in wait for them.</p>
<p>Approaching these poor creatures, as they are gazing about them with the
timidity and loneliness of strangers in a strange land, the scoundrels will
accost them in their own language.&nbsp; Glad to hear the mother-tongue 
once more, the emigrant readily enters into conversation with the fellow, 
and reveals to him his destination, his plans, and the amount of money he 
has with him.&nbsp; The sharper after some pleasantries meant to lull the 
suspicions of his victim, offers to show him where he can purchase his 
railroad tickets at a lower rate than at the office in the Landing Depot, 
and if the emigrant is willing, conducts him to a house in Washington, 
Greenwich, West, or some neighboring street, where a confederate sells him 
the so-called railroad tickets and receives his money.&nbsp; He is then 
conducted back to the Battery by a different route, and the sharper leaves 
him.&nbsp; Upon inquiring at the office, he learns <!-- page 821--><a 
name="page821"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 821</span>that his cheap 
tickets are so much worthless paper, and that he has been swindled out of 
his money, which may be his all.&nbsp; Of course he is unable to find the 
place where he was robbed, and has no redress for his loss.</p>
<p>Others again are led off, by persons who pretend to be friends, to take 
a friendly drink in a neighboring saloon.&nbsp; Their liquor is drugged, 
and they are soon rendered unconscious, when they are robbed of their 
money, valuables, and even their clothes, and turned out into the street in
this condition, to be picked up by the police.</p>
<p>All sorts of worthless wares are palmed off upon them by unscrupulous 
wretches.&nbsp; They are drawn into gaming and are fleeced out of their 
money.&nbsp; Dozens of sharpers are on the watch for them, and woe to them 
if they fall into the hands of these wretches.</p>
<p>Women are prominent amongst the enemies of the emigrants.&nbsp; The 
proprietors of the dance-houses and brothels of the city send their agents 
to the Battery, to watch their opportunity to entice the fresh, healthy 
emigrant girls to their hells.&nbsp; They draw them away by promises of 
profitable employment, and other shams, and carry them off to the houses of
their heartless masters and mistresses.&nbsp; There they are drugged and 
ruined, or in other ways literally forced into lives of shame.</p>
<h2><!-- page 822--><a name="page822"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
822</span>LXXXI.&nbsp; WORKING WOMEN.</h2>
<p>It is said that there are more than forty thousand women and girls in 
New York dependent upon their own exertions for their support.&nbsp; This 
estimate includes the sewing women, factory girls, shop girls, female 
clerks, teachers, and governesses.&nbsp; They all labor under two common 
disadvantages.&nbsp; They are paid less for the same amount of work than 
men, and being more helpless than men are more at the mercy of unscrupulous
employers.&nbsp; The female clerks and shop girls receive small wages, it 
is true, but they are generally paid regularly and honestly.&nbsp; The 
sewing women and factory hands are usually the most unfortunate, and these 
constitute the great bulk of the working women of New York.&nbsp; Many of 
these are married, or are widows with children dependent upon them for 
support.</p>
<p>The life of the New York working woman is very hard.&nbsp; She rises 
about daybreak, for she must have breakfast and be at her post by seven 
o&rsquo;clock, if employed in a factory or workshop.&nbsp; At noon she has 
a brief intermission for dinner, and then resumes her work, which lasts 
until 6 o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp; You may see them in the 
morning, thinly clad, weary and anxious, going in crowds to their 
work.&nbsp; They have few holidays except on Sunday, and but few pleasures 
at any time.&nbsp; Life with them is a constant struggle, and one in which 
they are always at a disadvantage.&nbsp; The sewing girls are in the 
majority, and there are two classes of these&mdash;those who work in the 
rooms of their employers and those who work at home.&nbsp; The former we 
have included in the general term of factory hands.&nbsp; The factory girls
earn from two to four dollars a week, as a rule, a sum scarcely sufficient 
to keep body and soul together, but they <!-- page 824--><a 
name="page824"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 824</span>get their wages 
promptly and consider themselves fortunate.&nbsp; Men doing the same work 
would receive about twice as much.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p823.jpg">
<img alt="THE SEWING-GIRL&rsquo;S HOME." src="images/p823.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The sewing women who work at home are worse off.&nbsp; They live in the 
poorer class of tenement houses, and are surrounded with discomfort of 
every kind.&nbsp; They work as hard as, if not harder than their sisters in
the factories, and are even worse paid.&nbsp; They have not the advantage 
of being compelled to undertake the exercise of walking to and from the 
factories which the latter enjoy.&nbsp; They sit in their wretched rooms 
all day, and often late into the night, sewing for a miserable pittance, 
and for some scoundrel who will perhaps swindle them out of their hard 
earnings.&nbsp; For making blue cotton shirts, or &ldquo;hickories&rdquo; 
as they are called, a woman receives six cents apiece, and must furnish her
own thread; for making linen coats she receives from fifteen to twenty 
cents apiece; for men&rsquo;s heavy overalls she gets sixty-two cents a 
dozen; for flannel shirts one dollar a dozen.&nbsp; These prices are not 
paid by the Jews alone, but by reputable Broadway dealers, men who style 
themselves &ldquo;leading merchants.&rdquo;&nbsp; No wonder they pile up 
such large fortunes.</p>
<p>Now, in order to pay the rent of her bare and cheerless room, the sewing
woman must make two whole shirts a day.&nbsp; Then she must do work enough 
to provide for her other expenses.&nbsp; She has to buy fuel in the winter,
and kindling wood costs her three cents a bundle and coal fifteen cents a 
pail.&nbsp; Perhaps she has children, or a sick and helpless, or, worse 
still, a drunken husband to provide for.&nbsp; All out of her beggarly 
wages.&nbsp; Her food consists almost entirely of bread and potatoes, and 
sometimes she treats herself to the luxury of a cup of tea without milk or 
sugar.&nbsp; If she owns a sewing machine, and very few do, she can earn 
more than one who sews by hand, but constant work at the machine means a 
speedy breaking down of her health and a lingering death, or a transfer to 
the charity hospital.</p>
<p>Small as are her wages, the working woman is not always sure of 
receiving them.&nbsp; Some rascally employers&mdash;and one of the 
institutions to be mentioned further on, could give a long list of 
them&mdash;will, upon receiving the work, find fault with the sewing, and 
either deduct a part of the poor creature&rsquo;s wages for the <!-- page 
825--><a name="page825"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 825</span>alleged 
fault, or refuse point blank to pay her a cent.&nbsp; Others again will 
demand a deposit equal to the value of the materials taken home by the 
sewing women.&nbsp; Upon the return of the completed work, they will not 
only refuse the promised payment, alleging that the work is badly done, but
will also refuse to return the money advanced by the woman.&nbsp; The 
wretch well knows that the woman is weak and helpless, and that she is 
ignorant of the mode of protecting herself.&nbsp; More than this, she has 
not the money to go to law.</p>
<p>These are simple facts, and not &ldquo;sensational items.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The records of the &ldquo;Working Women&rsquo;s Protective Union&rdquo; 
will corroborate them, and will furnish many others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the employ&eacute;s of a certain Israelitish manufacturer 
of straw goods in New York was a poor French woman, who, with her three 
small children, occupied apartments in a rear tenement house in Mulberry 
street.&nbsp; What renders this case of more than ordinary interest, is the
fact that the lady had once been in affluent circumstances, and at one 
period of her life moved in the wealthiest circles of Paris.&nbsp; 
Misfortune befel her in the death of her husband, who was accidentally 
killed upon a railroad train.&nbsp; The bulk of the property of her 
deceased husband was seized upon by her creditors.&nbsp; The widow, 
however, succeeded in saving from the general wreck a few hundred dollars, 
and with this she emigrated to America, arriving here in the spring, and 
bringing with her three little children.&nbsp; Here she anticipated she 
would be enabled, with the aid of her superior education, to provide for 
herself and family.&nbsp; For several weeks her efforts at securing 
employment proved unavailing; but just before her last dollar was expended,
she succeeded in forming a class in French, which she instructed for two 
months, at the expiration of which time she was deprived of this her only 
support&mdash;her pupils leaving her for the purpose of a summer&rsquo;s 
holiday at the fashionable watering-places.&nbsp; Other efforts were made 
to secure the position of teacher of languages (with several of which she 
is conversant), but all to no effect.&nbsp; Finally, reduced to absolute 
want, the lady was obliged to resort to manual labor in order to provide 
herself and little ones with bread.&nbsp; <!-- page 826--><a 
name="page826"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 826</span>Unused as she was to 
toil, her efforts to obtain employment were attended with little or no 
success.&nbsp; Day by day her case grew more desperate, until, at last, 
unable to pay the rent of her miserable attic apartment, she and her little
ones were thrust into the street.&nbsp; Homeless and friendless, with not 
sufficient money wherewith to purchase a supper for herself and famishing 
little ones, the lady was forced to beg; which course, up to this time in 
her unfortunate career, she had looked upon as barely preferable to death 
itself.&nbsp; She had a few acquaintances among the parents of her former 
pupils, and to these she resolved to apply for aid.&nbsp; Her efforts in 
this direction were but a repetition of the old, old story.&nbsp; Her 
friends, who, during her prosperity, were lavishing their attentions on 
her, now that misfortune had overtaken her, refused to recognize her, and 
thrust her from their doors without a penny.&nbsp; Fortune relented one 
day, and rewarded her efforts with a situation in a manufactory of straw 
goods.&nbsp; To be sure, the compensation was small; still, as bread enough
might be secured in this manner to keep the wolf from the door until 
something better might present itself, she resolved to accept the terms of 
the straw manufacturer, and entered upon her duties.&nbsp; For a week or 
two the sum earned by the unfortunate lady was faithfully paid her, but on 
the third week the pusillanimous nature of the Jew cropped out.&nbsp; She 
had bargained to manufacture straw hats at eighty cents a dozen, or six and
two-third cents each.&nbsp; At this rate, she managed to earn two dollars 
and fifty cents per week.&nbsp; Upon applying for her wages at the close of
the third week, the employer informed her that he had discovered that six 
and two-thirds cents apiece was too large a compensation, and that from 
eighty cents he had resolved to reduce her pay to seventy cents per dozen, 
and accordingly presented her with her weekly payment, first deducting one 
dollar and forty cents from her wages.&nbsp; Pressed as she was for money, 
the lady refused to accept these terms, and at once set about seeking legal
redress.&nbsp; Learning that at the &lsquo;Working Women&rsquo;s 
Union&rsquo; of Bleecker street legal advice was furnished free of charge 
to such as herself, she laid her grievances before the officers of the 
institution, who at once placed the affair in the <!-- page 827--><a 
name="page827"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 827</span>hands of their legal 
adviser, who soon brought the rapacious Israelite to terms.&nbsp; At the 
time of her application to the institution the lady stated that she had 
been without fire, and, with the exception of a small loaf or two of bread 
and what few potatoes her children were enabled to gather from about the 
stalls in several of the markets, without food for several days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wrongs inflicted upon the working women are many.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are hoop-skirt manufactories where, in the incessant din of machinery, 
girls stand upon weary feet all day long for fifty cents.&nbsp; There are 
photograph galleries&mdash;you pass them in Broadway admiringly&mdash;where
girls &lsquo;mount&rsquo; photographs in dark rooms, which are hot in 
summer and cold in winter, for the same money.&nbsp; There are girls who 
make fans, who work in feathers, who pick over and assort rags for paper 
warehouses, who act as &lsquo;strippers&rsquo; in tobacco shops, who make 
caps, and paper boxes, and toys, and almost all imaginable things.&nbsp; 
There are milliners&rsquo; girls, and bindery girls, and printers&rsquo; 
girls&mdash;press-feeders, book-folders, hat-trimmers.&nbsp; It is not to 
be supposed that all these places are objectionable; it is not to be 
supposed that all the places where sewing-girls work are objectionable; but
among each class there are very many&mdash;far too many&mdash;where evils 
of the gravest character exist, where the poor girls are wronged, the 
innocents suffer.&nbsp; There are places where there are not sufficient 
fires kept, in cold weather, and where the poor girl, coming in wet and 
shivering from the storm, must go immediately to work, wet as she is, and 
so continue all day.&nbsp; There are places where the &lsquo;silent 
system&rsquo; of prisons is rigidly enforced, where there are severe 
penalties for whispering to one&rsquo;s neighbor, and where the windows are
closely curtained, so that no girl can look out upon the street; thus, in 
advance, inuring the girls to the hardships of prison discipline, in view 
of the possibility that they may, some day become criminals!&nbsp; There 
are places where the employer treats his girls like slaves, in every sense 
of the word.&nbsp; Pause a moment, and reflect on all that signifies.&nbsp;
As in the South &lsquo;as it was,&rsquo; some of these girls are given 
curses, and even blows, and even <i>kicks</i>; while others are special 
favorites either of &lsquo;the boss,&rsquo; or of some of his male <!-- 
page 828--><a name="page828"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
828</span>subordinates, and dress well, pay four dollars a week for board, 
and fare well generally&mdash;on a salary of three dollars a 
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is it a wonder that so many of the working women and girls of New York 
glide into sin, with the hope of bettering their hard lot?&nbsp; And, when 
thrown out of work, with no food or shelter, save what can be obtained by 
begging or at the Station House, is it a wonder that they seek the concert 
saloons, in sheer desperation, or join the street walkers on Broadway?</p>
<p>But if the working woman has her persecutors, she has also her friends 
in the great city.&nbsp; One of the best institutions which have been 
organized for the protection and assistance of this class is the 
&ldquo;Working Women&rsquo;s Protective Union,&rdquo; the head-quarters of 
which are in Bleecker street, a short distance east of Broadway.&nbsp; It 
is organized for the common benefit of all those women who obtain a 
livelihood by other employments than household services.&nbsp; It aids 
them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>First</i>.&nbsp; By securing legal protection from frauds and 
impositions free of expense.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>.&nbsp; By appeals, 
respectfully but urgently made, to employers for wages proportioned to the 
cost of living, and for such shortening of the hours of labor as is due to 
health and the requirements of household affairs.&nbsp; <i>Third</i>.&nbsp;
By seeking new and appropriate spheres of labor in departments not now 
occupied by them.&nbsp; <i>Fourth</i>.&nbsp; By sustaining a registry 
system, through which those out of work may be assisted in finding 
employment.&nbsp; <i>Fifth</i>.&nbsp; By appeals to the community at large 
for that sympathy and support which is due to working women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The members each contribute the sum of ten dollars annually to the 
support of the institution.&nbsp; Outside aid is also liberally 
given.&nbsp; The Union has done much good since its organization.&nbsp; It 
has compelled dishonest employers to fulfil their contracts with their 
operatives, and in one single week compelled the payment of the sum of 
three hundred and twenty-five dollars, which had been withheld by these 
scoundrels.&nbsp; Out of two hundred complaints against employers in a 
single year, it secured a fair settlement of nearly two-thirds.&nbsp; In 
1869 it procured work for 3379 women and girls.&nbsp; It also looks after 
friendless and homeless women who seek its assistance, and helps them to 
secure employment.</p>

the applicant is found to be destitute.&nbsp; They have been tolerably 
successful thus far, and give promise of future usefulness.</p>
<p>There are several other associations, with similar objects, in operation
in the city.</p>
<p>Mr. A. T. Stewart is now erecting, on Fourth avenue, a magnificent iron 
building, which is to be used as a &ldquo;Home for Working 
Women.&rdquo;&nbsp; The building extends along the avenue, from 
Thirty-second to Thirty-third street, a distance of 192 feet, and has a 
depth of 205 feet.&nbsp; Including the central Mansard roofs, the building 
is eight stories in height.&nbsp; It is one of the finest edifices in the 
city, and will be provided with every convenience for the work to which it 
is destined.&nbsp; It will be capable of accommodating fifteen hundred 
boarders, and will be conducted on a plan similar to that of the 
&ldquo;Home for Working Women&rdquo; in Elizabeth street.&nbsp; It is not 
to be conducted as a charity.&nbsp; Each occupant is to pay a fixed sum per
week; and it is believed that here this sum will not exceed two dollars a 
week for board, lodging, and washing.</p>

831</span>LXXXII.&nbsp; STREET VENDERS.</h2>
<p>It is not known how many stores, or places in which trade is conducted 
beneath the shelter of a roof, the city contains.&nbsp; They are numerous, 
but they are not sufficient for the wants of trade.&nbsp; The sellers 
overflow them and spread out into the streets and by-ways, with no roof 
above them but the blue sky.&nbsp; Some of these sellers are men, some 
women, and some mere children.&nbsp; Some have large stationary stands, 
others roam about with their wares in boxes, bags, or baskets in their 
hands.&nbsp; They sell all manner of wares.&nbsp; Watches, jewelry, 
newspapers, fruits, tobacco, cigars, candies, cakes, ice cream, lemonade, 
flowers, dogs, birds,&mdash;in short everything that can be carried in the 
hand&mdash;are sold by the Street Venders.&nbsp; The rich and the poor buy 
of them.&nbsp; The strolling vagrant picks up his scanty breakfast at one 
of these stands, and the millionaire buys an apple at another.</p>
<p>The eating and apple stands are mainly kept by women.&nbsp; The most of 
them are Irishwomen, and the big cap and dirty frill under the quilted 
bonnet are among the most common signs of such a stand.&nbsp; Some of these
stands sell soups, some oysters, some coffee and hot cakes, some ice cream,
and some merely fruits and apples.&nbsp; In Wall street they are kept by 
men, and pies and cakes form the staple articles of trade.&nbsp; Candies 
and nuts are sold exclusively by many.&nbsp; Such candies as are not to be 
had of any confectioner in town.&nbsp; Women never sell cigars or tobacco, 
though many of them never take their pipes from their mouths during 
business hours.&nbsp; Some of them offer ladies&rsquo; hose and 
gentlemen&rsquo;s socks, and suspenders, yarns, worsted hoods, and 
gloves.&nbsp; A few women sell newspapers, but these are rapidly giving way
to men.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 832--><a name="page832"></a><span

<a href="images/p832.jpg">
<img alt="STREET VENDERS." src="images/p832.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 833--><a name="page833"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
833</span>The newspaper stands are located principally on Broadway, in Wall
street, and around the Post Office and the ferries.&nbsp; At some of them 
only the morning or evening journals are kept, but others offer all the 
weeklies and the illustrated papers as well.</p>
<p>The venders of cheap neckties and pocket book straps are mostly boys or 
very young men.&nbsp; They frequent the lower part of Broadway, which is 
also the favorite haunt of the venders of cheap jewelry.&nbsp; Pocket books
of every description are sold at marvellously cheap prices, and photographs
are displayed in such lavish quantities that you feel sure that every 
dealer in them has bankrupted himself in order to afford a free art 
exhibition to the crowd of little ragamuffins gathered around him.&nbsp; 
Toys of every contrivance adorn the stands above Canal street.&nbsp; The 
dealers in these articles are strong, able-bodied men, who prefer to stand 
on the side walks pulling the strings of a jumping jack, or making 
contortions with a toy contrived for that purpose, to a more manly way of 
earning their bread.</p>
<p>The balloon men, the penny whistle and pop gun dealers frequent the 
upper streets, where they are apt to be seen by children.&nbsp; The lame 
soldier sets up his stand anywhere, and deals principally in shoe strings, 
neckties, or in books and papers that no one ever reads.&nbsp; Towards 
Christmas large booths for the sale of toys are erected on some of the east
and west side streets, at which a thriving business in toys and fire-works 
is carried on.</p>
<p>The Chinese candy and cigar sellers are to be found between the Astor 
House and the South Ferry.&nbsp; No one ever seems to buy from them, but 
they continue in the business, and thus afford proof positive that they 
have their customers.</p>
<p>The dog and bird men haunt the neighborhood of the Astor House and St. 
Nicholas hotels.&nbsp; They get high prices for their pets.&nbsp; Dogs sell
readily.&nbsp; It is the fashion in New York to discourage the increase of 
families, and to attempt to satisfy the half-smothered maternal instinct by
petting these dumb creatures.</p>
<p>Little girls are numerous among the street venders.&nbsp; They sell 
matches, tooth-picks, cigars, newspapers, songs and flowers.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 834--><a name="page834"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 834</span>The 
flower-girls are hideous little creatures, but their wares are beautiful 
and command a ready sale.&nbsp; These are made into hand bouquets, and 
buttonhole bouquets, and command from ten cents to several dollars 
each.&nbsp; When the day is wet and gloomy, and the slush and the mud of 
Broadway are thick over everything animate and inanimate, and the sensitive
soul shrinks within itself at the sight of so much discomfort, the 
flower-girls do a good business.&nbsp; The flower-stands then constitute 
the most attractive objects on the street, and men are irresistibly drawn 
to them by the sight of their exquisite adornments.&nbsp; It is very 
pleasant at such times to have a bright, fragrant nosegay in one&rsquo;s 
buttonhole, or to carry a bouquet to one&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; On such days 
you may see hundreds of splashed and muddy men on the great thoroughfare, 
utterly hopeless of preserving any outward semblance of neatness, but each 
with his nosegay in his buttonhole; and as he glances down at it, from time
to time, you may see his weary face soften and brighten, and an expression 
of cheerfulness steal over it, which renders him proof against even the 
depressing influences of the mud and the rain.</p>
<h2><!-- page 835--><a name="page835"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
835</span>LXXXIII.&nbsp; THE WHARVES.</h2>
<p>No visitor to New York should omit visiting the wharves of the North and
East rivers.&nbsp; A day may be profitably spent on the shore of each 
stream.&nbsp; The docks do not compare favorably with the massive 
structures of Liverpool, or London, or the other great seaports of the 
world.&nbsp; They are wretched, half decayed and dirty; but ere long they 
are to be replaced with a system of magnificent stone and iron piers, which
will afford all the desired facilities, and render New York in this respect
one of the best provided ports on the globe.</p>
<p>Beginning at the Battery on the North River side, we find first the pier
of the famous Camden and Amboy Railway Company, from which passengers and 
freights are conveyed to the railway by steamer.&nbsp; Above this are the 
piers of the great European steamship lines, the coast steamers, and the 
steamboats plying between the city and the neighboring towns.&nbsp; The 
Boston boats, all of which run to points in Connecticut and Rhode Island, 
where they make connections with the railways to Boston, are fine 
steamers.&nbsp; Those of the Narragansett Steamship Company, the Bristol 
and Providence by name, are the most magnificent steamers in the 
world.&nbsp; They cost $1,250,000 apiece.&nbsp; They are simply floating 
palaces, as are also the Albany night boats.&nbsp; The foreign steamers are
huge iron vessels, carrying thousands of tons of freight and hundreds of 
passengers.&nbsp; The sailing of one of these ships always draws a crowd to
her pier, and though from five to eight of them leave the port every week, 
the attraction still continues.</p>
<p>The ferries to Jersey City and Hoboken are all located on this river, 
and are full of interest to the stranger.&nbsp; The Bethel, <!-- page 
836--><a name="page836"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 836</span>or floating 
chapel for seamen, is also worth visiting.&nbsp; The ice trade of the city 
is carried on on this front, the principal supply of that article being 
obtained along the river, about one hundred miles above the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p836.jpg">
<img alt="BOAT STORES." src="images/p836.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The oyster boats, or boat stores, are peculiar to New York.&nbsp; They 
lie chiefly in the vicinity of Christopher street, and are sources of 
considerable profit to their owners.&nbsp; The Hay Scales are also curious 
objects.&nbsp; At the foot of Fifty-fourth street the numerous telegraph 
lines which connect New York with the States south of it, cross the 
Hudson.&nbsp; They gain the Jersey shore in the vicinity of the Elysian 
Fields at Hoboken, and thence continue their way to every part of the 
States mentioned.</p>
<p>The East River front is the terminus of the ferry lines to Brooklyn, 
Long Island City, and Hunter&rsquo;s Point.&nbsp; The shipping here 
consists almost entirely of sailing vessels.&nbsp; The craft plying between
New York and the New England towns have their stations here, and here also 
are the California clippers.&nbsp; The <!-- page 837--><a 
name="page837"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 837</span>huge Indiamen lie 
here receiving or discharging cargo.&nbsp; The whole river front is covered
with merchandise representing the products of every land under the sun.</p>
<p>The Floating Docks are among the principal sights of the East River, as 
are also the vast coal and ship yards.&nbsp; This stream will soon he 
spanned by an immense suspension bridge which is to connect the City Hall 
in New York with the City Hall in Brooklyn.&nbsp; The total length of the 
bridge and its approaches is to be 5878 feet.&nbsp; The bridge is to rest 
on cables, supported by massive stone towers at the water&rsquo;s edge on 
each side.&nbsp; The span between these towers is to be 1616 feet.&nbsp; 
From each tower the flooring is to be carried a further distance of 940 
feet to the land approaches.&nbsp; The New York approach is to be 1441 
feet, and the Brooklyn approach 941 feet in length.&nbsp; The approaches 
will, in some instances, be on a level with the tops of the houses in the 
cities through which they pass.&nbsp; The total height of the bridge above 
the tide is to be 268 feet.&nbsp; The work is now progressing rapidly, and 
will be completed in about three years.</p>
<p>Accidents are very common in every large port, but the peculiar 
construction of the New York ferry houses renders the number of cases of 
drowning doubly great.&nbsp; In order to guard against this, and to afford 
timely assistance to persons in danger of drowning, &ldquo;rescue 
stations&rdquo; have been established along the water front of the 
city.&nbsp; There is one at each ferry house, and the others are located at
the points where accidents are most likely to occur.&nbsp; These stations 
are each provided with a ladder of sufficient length to reach from the pier
to the water at low tide, with hooks at one end, by means of which it is 
attached firmly to the pier; a boat hook fastened to a long pole; a life 
preserver or float, and a coil of rope.&nbsp; These are merely deposited in
a conspicuous place.&nbsp; In case of accident, any one may use them for 
the purpose of rescuing a person in danger of drowning, but at other times 
it is punishable by law to interfere with them, or to remove them.&nbsp; 
The station is in charge of the policeman attached to the 
&ldquo;beat&rdquo; in which it is located, and he has the exclusive right 
in the absence of one of his superior officers to direct all 
proceedings.&nbsp; At the same time, he is required to comply strictly <!--
page 838--><a name="page838"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 838</span>with 
the law regulating such service on his part, and to render every assistance
in his power.&nbsp; The law for the government of persons using the 
&ldquo;rescue apparatus&rdquo; is posted conspicuously by the side of the 
implements, as are also concise and simple directions as to the best method
of attempting to resuscitate drowned persons.&nbsp; These stations have 
been of the greatest use since their establishment, and reflect the highest
credit upon those who originated and introduced them.</p>
<h2><!-- page 839--><a name="page839"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
839</span>LXXXIV.&nbsp; THE MORGUE.</h2>
<p>There stands on the shore of the East River, at the foot of Twenty-sixth
street, a massive gray-stone building, known as Bellevue Hospital.&nbsp; 
Over the lowest door of the front, on the upper side of Twenty-sixth 
street, is a single word in gilt letters&mdash;MORGUE.&nbsp; This door 
marks the entrance to the Dead House of New York, one of the most 
repulsive, but most terribly fascinating places in the city.&nbsp; The 
place is named after the famous dead house of Paris, and the interior is 
arranged in exact imitation of it, except that it is smaller.&nbsp; It is a
gloomy-looking place, this Morgue, and it is always crowded.&nbsp; Bodies 
found in the streets or in the harbor are brought here for 
identification.&nbsp; They are kept a certain length of time, usually from 
twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and if not claimed by relatives or 
friends, are buried at the expense of the city.&nbsp; Every article of 
clothing, every trinket, or other means of identification, found with a 
body, is carefully preserved, in the hope that it may lead to a discovery 
of the cause of the death.</p>
<p>The room is gloomy and cell-like in appearance.&nbsp; It is about twenty
feet square.&nbsp; The floor is of brick tiles, and the walls are rough and
heavy.&nbsp; The apartment is divided into two unequal portions by a 
partition of glass and iron.&nbsp; The smaller portion is used by the 
public.&nbsp; The remainder is devoted to the purposes of the 
establishment.&nbsp; Back of the glass screen are four stone tables on iron
frames, each with its foot towards the glass.&nbsp; Stretched on these are 
lifeless naked forms, each covered with a sheet.&nbsp; A stream of cold 
water, from a movable jet, falls over the lifeless face of each and 
trickles over the senseless forms, warding off decay until the last moment,
in the hope that <!-- page 841--><a name="page841"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 841</span>some one to whom the dead man or woman was 
dear in life will come and claim the body.&nbsp; A vain hope, generally, 
for but few bodies are claimed.&nbsp; Nearly all go to the potter&rsquo;s 
field.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p840.jpg">
<img alt="THE MORGUE." src="images/p840.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>A fearful company, truly, as they lie there, cold and rigid, their 
ghastly features lighted by the chilly gleams which fall from the windows 
above.&nbsp; Here is the body of an infant, its little life of suffering 
over.&nbsp; It was found in an ash barrel in an alley.&nbsp; On the next 
slab is the form of a man who was evidently well to do in the world.&nbsp; 
He is a stranger to the city, the Superintendent tells you, and dropped in 
the streets from apoplexy.&nbsp; His friends will no doubt claim him before
the day is over, as the articles found on his person have established his 
identity.&nbsp; The next table contains the body of a woman.&nbsp; She was 
young and must have been fair.&nbsp; She was found in the river, and as 
there are no marks of violence on her person, the presumption is that she 
sought her own destruction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such cases are becoming 
common,&rdquo; says the Superintendent in his matter of fact way.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;They are very sad, but we see too many of them to think them 
romantic.&rdquo;&nbsp; A shudder comes over you as you gaze at the ghastly 
occupant of the last table.&nbsp; The dead man was evidently a gentleman, 
for he bears every mark of a person of good position in life.&nbsp; His 
purple, swollen features tell you plainly that he was taken from the 
river.&nbsp; There is a deep wound in his side, and marks of violence are 
numerous about his head and neck.&nbsp; You gaze at the Superintendent 
inquiringly, and even that cool, clear-headed official turns a shade paler 
as he answers, almost under his breath, &ldquo;Murdered.&nbsp; For his 
money, doubtless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the walls back of the tables are suspended the clothing of the 
unfortunates, and of others who have preceded them.&nbsp; Maybe some friend
will come along and recognize them, and the one who has been missing will 
be traced to this sad place.&nbsp; They form a strange collection, but they
speak chiefly of poverty and suffering.</p>
<p>The dark waters of the rivers and bay send many an inmate to this gloomy
room.&nbsp; The harbor police, making their early morning rounds, find some
dark object floating in the waters.&nbsp; <!-- page 842--><a 
name="page842"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 842</span>It is scarcely light 
enough to distinguish it, but the men know well what it is.&nbsp; They are 
accustomed to such things.&nbsp; They grapple it and tow it in silent 
horror past the long lines of shipping, and pause only when the Morgue 
looms up coldly before them in the uncertain light of the breaking 
day.&nbsp; The still form is lifted out of the water, and carried swiftly 
into the gloomy building.&nbsp; It is laid on the marble slab, stripped, 
covered with a sheet, the water is turned on, and the room is deserted and 
silent again.</p>
<p>So many come here on their way to their long homes.&nbsp; The average 
number is about two hundred per year.&nbsp; You can scarcely take up a city
newspaper without finding one or more advertisements of persons 
&ldquo;lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of them come here.&nbsp; Many are never 
heard of again.&nbsp; The waters which encompass the city keep well the 
secrets confided to them, and neither the Morgue nor the Police books can 
tell the fate of all the missing.&nbsp; Strangers visiting the city often 
venture into the chosen haunts of crime &ldquo;to see the sights,&rdquo; 
and in so doing place themselves in the power of the most desperate and 
reckless villains.&nbsp; Human life is held so cheap here, and murder has 
become such a profession, that no respectable person is safe who ventures 
into these localities.&nbsp; You may often see at the Morgue, where the 
majority of the bodies show marks of violence, the lifeless forms of those 
who but a few days before left their pleasant homes in other portions of 
the country to see the metropolis.&nbsp; A visit to a concert saloon or a 
dance house, merely from what they consider the most innocent curiosity, 
has sealed their doom.&nbsp; A glass of drugged liquor has destroyed their 
power of self-protection, and even without this they have been 
assaulted.&nbsp; They are helpless, and they have paid with their lives the
price of their &ldquo;innocent curiosity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the River and 
the Morgue complete the story; or perhaps the River keeps its secret, and 
the dead man&rsquo;s name goes down on the long list of the missing.</p>
<p>Strangers, and all others who would see New York, should content 
themselves with its innocent sights and amusements.&nbsp; Those who seek to
pass beneath the shadow willfully take their lives in their hands.</p>
<h2><!-- page 843--><a name="page843"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
843</span>LXXXV.&nbsp; THE CUSTOM HOUSE.</h2>
<p>The Custom House is one of the most prominent and interesting places in 
New York.&nbsp; It is one of the largest in the country, and is provided 
with every facility for the prompt despatch of the vast business transacted
in it.&nbsp; Five-sixths of all the duties on imports collected in the 
United States are received here.</p>
<p>The Custom House building was formerly the Merchants&rsquo; 
Exchange.&nbsp; It is one of the handsomest structures in the city, and its
purchase cost the General Government one million of dollars in gold.&nbsp; 
The building is constructed of solid granite, with a fine portico and 
colonnade in front.&nbsp; If is fire-proof throughout.&nbsp; It occupies 
the entire block bounded by Wall street, Exchange Place, William street, 
and Hanover street.&nbsp; Its dimensions are a depth of two hundred feet, a
frontage of one hundred and forty-four feet, and a rear breadth of one 
hundred and seventy-one feet.&nbsp; The top of the central dome is one 
hundred and twenty-four feet from the ground.&nbsp; The main entrance is on
Wall street, but there are entrances on every side.&nbsp; The Rotunda 
occupies the space beneath the central dome, and is one of the finest 
interiors in the country.</p>
<p>Within the Rotunda are arranged rows of desks, running parallel with the
walls.&nbsp; These are occupied by four &ldquo;deputy collectors,&rdquo; 
three &ldquo;chief clerks,&rdquo; five &ldquo;entry clerks,&rdquo; two 
&ldquo;bond clerks,&rdquo; the &ldquo;foreign clearance clerk&rdquo; and 
his assistant, and by those whose duties bring them most commonly in 
contact with the merchants, shippers, commanders of vessels, etc., in the 
ordinary routine of the business of the port.&nbsp; The Collector and the 
higher officials have handsome offices in other parts of the building.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 844--><a name="page844"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 844</span>
<a href="images/p844.jpg">
<img alt="THE CUSTOM HOUSE." src="images/p844.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>There are about 1100 clerks attached to the Custom House, whose total 
wages amount to about $3,000,000 per annum.&nbsp; The legal salary of the 
Collector is $6000 per annum, but his fees and perquisites make up an 
actual income of five or six times that amount.&nbsp; The Collectorship of 
this port is the best paying office within the gift of the 
Government.&nbsp; Colonel <!-- page 845--><a name="page845"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 845</span>Thorpe thus sums up the duties of the various 
officers of the port:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Collector shall receive all reports, manifests, and documents
to be made or exhibited on the entry of any ship or vessel; shall record, 
on books to be kept for that purpose, all manifests; shall receive the 
entries of all ships or vessels, and of the goods, wares, and merchandise 
imported in them; shall estimate the amount of the duties payable 
thereupon, indorsing said amount on the respective entries; shall receive 
all moneys paid for duties, and take all bonds for securing the payment 
thereof; shall, with the approbation of the Secretary of the Treasury, 
employ proper personages&mdash;weighers, gaugers, measurers, and 
inspectors&mdash;at the port within his district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Naval Officer shall receive <i>copies</i> of all manifests 
and entries; shall estimate the duties on all goods, wares, and merchandise
subject to duty (and no duties shall be received without such estimate), 
and shall keep a separate record thereof; and shall <i>countersign</i> all 
permits, clearances, certificates, debentures, and other documents granted 
by the Collector.&nbsp; He shall also examine the Collector&rsquo;s 
abstract of duties, his accounts, receipts, bonds, and expenditures, and, 
if found correct, shall certify the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Surveyor shall superintend and direct all inspectors, 
weighers, measurers, and gaugers; shall visit and inspect the ships and 
vessels; shall return in writing every morning to the Collector the name 
and nationality of all vessels which shall have arrived from foreign ports;
shall examine all goods, wares, and merchandise imported, to see that they 
agree with the inspector&rsquo;s return; and shall see that all goods 
intended for exportation correspond with the entries, and permits granted 
therefor; and the said Surveyor shall, in all cases, be subject to the 
Collector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Appraisers&rsquo; department is simply for the purpose of 
deciding the market values and dutiable character of all goods imported, so
that the imposts can be laid with correctness.&nbsp; Other than this, it 
has no connection with the Custom House.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 846--><a name="page846"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
846</span>There is located at the Battery, an old white building, 
surmounted by a light tower.&nbsp; This is the Barge office, and is the 
headquarters of the Inspectors attached to the Surveyor&rsquo;s office, who
are under the orders of Mr. John L. Van Buskirk, now nearly 89 years of 
age, and who has been &ldquo;Assistant to the surveyor&rdquo; for many 
years.&nbsp; The arrivals of all ships are reported from the telegraph 
station at Sandy Hook, and as soon as it is announced at the barge office 
that a steamer or ship &ldquo;from foreign ports&rdquo; is off soundings, 
two Inspectors are placed on a revenue cutter, and sent down to take charge
of the arriving vessel.&nbsp; From the moment they set foot on the 
vessel&rsquo;s deck, they are in supreme control of the cargo and 
passengers.&nbsp; One would think from the manner in which many of them 
conduct themselves toward passengers, that an American citizen coming home 
from abroad has no rights but such as the Inspector chooses to accord 
him.&nbsp; Certainly the joy which an American feels in returning to his 
own home is very effectually dampened by the contrast which he is compelled
to draw between the courtesy and fairness of the customs officials of 
European lands, and the insolence and brutality of those into whose 
clutches he falls upon entering the port of New York.&nbsp; The Inspectors 
examine the baggage of the cabin passengers, collect the imposts on 
dutiable articles, and send them ashore.&nbsp; They then send the steerage 
passengers to Castle Garden where they are examined.&nbsp; After this, the 
ship is allowed to go alongside of her pier, where her cargo is discharged 
under their inspection, and carted to the Bonded Warehouses of the United 
States, for appraisement and collection of duties.</p>
<p>Passing goods through the Custom House is a troublesome and intricate 
undertaking, and most merchants employ a Broker to perform that duty for 
them.&nbsp; A novice might spend hours in wandering about the labyrinths of
the huge building, trying to find the proper officials.&nbsp; The broker 
knows every nook and corner in the establishment, and where to find the 
proper men, and moreover manages to secure the good will of the officials 
so that he is never kept waiting, but is given every facility for the 
despatch of his business.&nbsp; The fee for &ldquo;passing <!-- page 
847--><a name="page847"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 847</span>an 
entry&rdquo; is five dollars.&nbsp; Sometimes a broker will pass fifty 
different entries in a single day, thus earning $250.&nbsp; Some brokers 
make handsome fortunes in their business.&nbsp; When there is a dispute 
between the government and the importer as to the value of the goods or the
amount of the duty, the broker&rsquo;s work is tedious and slow.&nbsp; The 
large importing houses have their regular brokers at stated salaries.</p>
<h2><!-- page 848--><a name="page848"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
848</span>LXXXVI.&nbsp; MISSING.</h2>
<p>It is a common and almost meaningless remark, that one has to be careful
to avoid being lost in New York, but the words &ldquo;Lost in New 
York&rdquo; have a deeper meaning than the thoughtless speakers 
imagine.&nbsp; If the curious would know the full force of these words, let
them go to the Police Headquarters, in Mulberry street, and ask for the 
&ldquo;Bureau for the Recovery of Lost Persons.&rdquo;&nbsp; The records of
this bureau abound in stories of mystery, of sorrow, and of crime.</p>
<p>As many as seven hundred people have been reported as 
&ldquo;lost,&rdquo; to this bureau, in a single year, and it is believed 
that this does not include all the disappearances.&nbsp; Many of those so 
reported are found, as in the cases of old persons and children, but many 
disappear forever.&nbsp; Others who are recovered by their friends are 
never reported as found to the bureau, and consequently remain on its books
as missing.</p>
<p>When a person is reported &ldquo;Missing&rdquo; to this bureau, a 
description of the age, height, figure, whiskers, if any, color of eyes, 
dress, hair, the place where last seen, the habits and disposition of the 
person, is given to the official in charge, who enters it in the 
register.&nbsp; When the returns of the Morgue, which are sent to the 
Police authorities every twenty-four hours, are received, they are compared
with the descriptions in the register, and in this way bodies are often 
identified.&nbsp; Five or six hundred cards with the description of the 
missing person are printed, and sent to the various police precincts, with 
orders to the commanding officers to make a vigilant search for the person 
so described.&nbsp; Advertisements are also inserted in the newspapers 
describing the missing ones.&nbsp; Many of the estrays are children, and 
these are usually recovered within twenty-four hours.&nbsp; These little 
ones usually fall directly into the hands of the police, and are taken at 
once to the station house.&nbsp; <!-- page 550--><a

they are sent at nightfall to Police Headquarters, where they are cared for
until their friends come for them.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Many of the missing are men&mdash;strangers to the city.&nbsp; They have
come here on business or for pleasure, and have undertaken to see the 
sights of New York.&nbsp; They have drowned their senses in liquor, and 
have fallen into the hands of the thieves and murderers, who are ever on 
the watch for such as they.&nbsp; They have been robbed and murdered, 
thrown into the river, from which they sometimes find their way to the 
Morgue.&nbsp; Or perhaps they have followed some street walker to her den, 
there to fall victims to the knife or club of her accomplice.&nbsp; The 
river is close at hand, and it hides its secrets well.&nbsp; Year after 
year the same thing goes on, and men pay with their lives the price of 
their impure curiosity.&nbsp; The street walker still finds her victim 
ready to follow her to her den, for &ldquo;he knoweth not that the dead are
there: and that her guests are in the depths of hell.&nbsp; He goeth after 
her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the 
correction of the stocks.&nbsp; Till a dart strike through his liver, and 
knoweth not that it is for his life.&nbsp; She hath cast down many wounded;
yea, many strong men have been slain by her.&nbsp; Her house is the way to 
hell, going down to the chambers of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Year after year the waters cast up their dead, and the Morgue is filled 
with those who are known to the police as &ldquo;missing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men 
and women, the victims of the assassin, and those who are tired of life, 
find their way to the ghastly tables of the dead house; but they are not 
all.&nbsp; There are long rows of names in the dreary register of the 
police against which the entry &ldquo;found&rdquo; is never written.&nbsp; 
What has become of them, whether they are living or dead, no one 
knows.&nbsp; They were &ldquo;lost in New York,&rdquo; and they are 
practically dead to those interested in knowing their fate.&nbsp; Year 
after year the sad list lengthens.</p>
<p>In many a far off home there is mourning for some loved one.&nbsp; Years
have passed away since the sorrow came upon these mourners, but the cloud 
still hangs over them.&nbsp; Their loved one was &ldquo;lost in New 
York.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is all they know&mdash;all they will ever know.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
